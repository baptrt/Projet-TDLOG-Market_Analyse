Tesla ( TSLA 1.10% ) shares have been on a wild ride in 2025 with investors engaged in a tug of war of sorts, between bears and bulls. The bears base their position in reality, a reality where Tesla sales and profits are in decline and its vehicle lineup is aging. The bulls base their position in a potentially lucrative future based around artificial intelligence (AI), robotics , and robotaxis . Right now, the bulls are winning with Tesla stock up 28% over the past three months, but here's why investors might want to pump the brakes a bit. \"Safe, routine, ready: Autonomous driving in new cities\" are the words that should have Tesla investors pumping the brakes on the potentially lucrative future they envisioned for the electric vehicle (EV) maker. That's because direct competitor Waymo is shifting its expansion into a higher gear: \"We've built a generalizable Driver, powered by Waymo's demonstrably safe AI, and an operational playbook to reliably achieve this milestone,\" said Tekedra Mawakana, Waymo's co-CEO, on the expansion, according to Electrek. This week, Waymo announced fully autonomous driving in five new cities: Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando. Operations started in Miami this week and will begin in the remaining four cities in the coming weeks, although it's important to note that doors for riders won't open until next year. This goes with Waymo's recent playbook to test for a few months before opening the app to the public. It's also important for investors to grasp the lead that Waymo may have developed over the past few years. For instance, Tesla is currently testing its initial robotaxi operations in Austin, Texas, with roughly 30 robotaxis in operation and plans to expand the fleet to about 500 by the end of the year. Tesla is still using a safety monitor, which Waymo removed in 2020, but has plans to transition to fully driverless operation by the end of the year. Tesla Cybercab. Image source: Tesla. The five new cities that Waymo is entering will bring its total city count to 10 at a time when Tesla just announced it obtained a permit to operate a ride-hailing service in Arizona. It's definitely a step forward for Tesla, although additional permits will be required before the automaker can operate a full robotaxi service in the state. When Tesla enters the Phoenix, Arizona market next year, it will already trail Waymo's operations in the city, which boasts at least 400 autonomous vehicles. In fact, Waymo said it has already surpassed 10 million driverless trips served to riders across its U.S. operations. Despite Tesla playing catch up to rival Waymo, Tesla investors have some reason to be optimistic. Tesla could very well develop a competitive advantage in scaling a robotaxi business thanks to access to a plethora of Tesla vehicles on the road and its production capacity. Furthermore, Tesla's strategic rollout could be more scalable as the company is relying on a camera-based system rather than LiDAR and radar, which competitors are using. Tesla shareholders also made it clear where they want CEO Elon Musk's focus. Musk's new compensation package, worth up to $1 trillion, was approved by 75% of voters but with milestones tied to future endeavors. Musk will still have to build cars for some of his rewards, have 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation, 1 million Optimus robots, and 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions. These goals suggest the company is pivoting its core business from automotive manufacturer to a more tech-centric company. Tesla's best days may very well be ahead of it. It's already proven many naysayers wrong by making it this far, but it's important for investors to pump the brakes on robotaxi hype, because not only is Tesla playing catch up to Waymo; the future of robotaxis is more uncertain thanks to evolving regulations, lawsuits, and safety concerns. Investors need to understand what company they're investing in moving forward, given Tesla's lofty valuation and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio approaching 300 times, and a market capitalization more than 10 times Ford and GM combined.

Billionaire Philippe Laffont is a tiger cub, meaning he's part of an elite group of investors who worked for Julian Robertson's Tiger Global Management in the 1990s and then went on to found his own fund, Coatue Management. Laffont made early investments in TikTok's parent company ByteDance, Snap , Tesla , Meta Platforms , and Spotify , among others. Needless to say, Laffont can typically spot the big tech trends before they happen, which is why investors are always so eager to get a glimpse into Coatue's portfolio each quarter. In the third quarter, Coatue trimmed its positions in CoreWeave ( CRWV +3.53% ) , Tesla, and Nvidia ( NVDA 0.97% ) , and invested in two recent initial public offerings. Image source: Getty Images. Coatue appeared to follow the broader institutional investor landscape in the quarter, reducing its stake in several prominent artificial intelligence (AI) companies . Coatue sold 62% of its position in the AI data center company CoreWeave, 15% of its position in the electric vehicle and robotaxi company Tesla, and 14% of its position in the AI chip giant Nvidia. In recent months, investors have become increasingly concerned about AI valuations, which have long been high, as well as the macroeconomic environment, with investors penciling in a smaller chance of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in December. Furthermore, other AI concerns have emerged, including the large amounts of money the hyperscalers are spending to build out AI infrastructure, which is expected to be in the trillions over the next five years. Other well-known investors like Michael Burry have been more outspoken on social media regarding concerns over how large AI companies like Oracle and Meta Platforms are accounting for depreciation of semiconductors and servers, specifically as they extend the useful life of them, despite uncertainty about how long they will really last. Other broader concerns that are coming into the spotlight are whether the U.S. can generate enough electricity to meet the demand for AI. Manufacturing AI chips also requires significant water usage, another issue related to the amount of resources needed to power AI. Ultimately, it's difficult to predict what will happen next in terms of whether this marks the beginning of a pullback or a buy-the-dip opportunity. I don't think AI is about to become irrelevant, but the sector's path is unclear. Investors should be long-term-focused, and in my view, try to avoid some of the higher valuations out there, such as Tesla's. On its third-quarter 13F filing, Coatue reported positions in both the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) company Klarna ( KLAR +3.42% ) and the collaborative design tech company Figma ( FIG +2.20% ) , both of which were high-profile IPOs this year. Figma went public with tremendous hype, opening at $33 per share and rising to a high of $143 per share, although it would be short-lived. The company essentially provides a Google Docs-like workflow for designers and coders to collaborate on a range of projects, allowing multiple people to work on designs that can be easily translated into code for website or app implementation. The company also has AI components and is being integrated as a third party into ChatGPT. Coatue actually got involved in the company prior to the IPO, investing in it in 2024 at a $12.5 billion valuation. While selling the stock immediately following the IPO and the huge jump would have been a no-brainer, IPOs often contain lock-up provisions preventing this practice. At the end of the third quarter, Coatue held over 3.2 million shares. Investors should still likely be wary of the stock, which has come down significantly after the initial IPO pop. Even at its current $18 billion market cap, Figma is still unprofitable and trades at over 17 times forward revenue . Coatue also reported owning 330,000 shares of Klarna at the end of the third quarter. I haven't found any evidence that Coatue ever participated in a private financing round of Klarna prior to this report, although it's certainly possible. However, it's also possible that Coatue recently scooped up shares. Klarna's IPO also started hot, but has since fallen below its IPO price. Klarna trades at a more reasonable valuation than Figma, at about 4 times forward revenue, but its losses have also risen significantly. BNPL companies are heavily impacted by the health of the consumer and the economy, so while the company has potential to disrupt the credit card space, I am still cautious on Klarna at this valuation.

Elon Musk’s electric car giant claimed European officials were clinging to outdated rules and regulations, which it said were holding back the technology. It comes as Tesla hopes to debut its self-driving cars in Europe in 2026, five years after Mr Musk first said they could be rolled out across the Continent. Tesla said on social media that it had been locked in talks with European regulators for more than a year to release its full self-driving technology, which allows its vehicles to drive almost unaided. It said Tesla was yet to gain approval despite recording one million kilometres on European roads across 17 countries as part of various tests. Tesla is now working towards securing an initial licence in the Netherlands. In a post on X, Tesla claimed that Dutch regulators had committed to approving its technology by February next year. Mr Musk has blamed Europe’s “layer cake of regulations and bureaucracy” for delaying self-driving technology, which has been available in America since 2020. He said earlier this year that the hold-up was “very frustrating and hurts the safety of people in Europe”. To bypass the EU’s strict regulation, Tesla is now seeking to rely on an exemption for “yet-to-be-regulated behaviours” to introduce its self-driving software. However, it warned that the bloc’s “outdated” regulations could make its technology “illegal in its current form” and render its vehicles “unsafe and unusable in many cases”. It called on its drivers to lobby the Dutch authorities for approval. Tesla has launched its full self-driving software in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, and the US, which allows cars to drive themselves on most roads and motorways. The electric car giant is also testing its self-driving technology on UK roads, revealing videos of its cars driving autonomously on London’s streets and on Swindon’s notorious Magic Roundabout junction. The UK is also preparing to approve self-driving taxis in Britain from next spring, having already rolled out the service in Texas. It comes as the electric carmaker seeks to diversify its revenues to combat falling car sales, with many drivers shunning Tesla over the past year in protest of Mr Musk’s support for Donald Trump. This led to Chinese rival BYD overtaking Tesla in Europe for the first time earlier this year. Sign in to access your portfolio"},
{"company": "AAPL", "title": "This Is My Favorite Warren Buffett Stock, and It's One of His Biggest Bets (Hint: It's Not Apple or Alphabet)", "publisher": "Motley Fool", "link": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/24/this-is-my-favorite-warren-buffett-stock-and-its-o/", "summary": "Consistently growing its earnings per share at robust double-digit rates, this stock is my favorite of Warren Buffett's investments.", "time": "2025-11-24 05:31:00", "full_text": "Consistently growing its earnings per share at robust double-digit rates, this stock is my favorite of Warren Buffett's investments. Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A +0.09% ) ( BRK.B +0.58% ) has turned a small group of companies into enormous bets over the past decade, and Apple ( AAPL +1.97% ) has dominated that list for years. Given Berkshire chairman and CEO Warren Buffett's successful track record with stocks, investors are often looking at the company's stock holdings -- especially its biggest ones -- to get investment ideas. And now a newly disclosed stake in Google parent Alphabet ( GOOG +3.33% ) ( GOOGL +3.50% ) has reinvigorated interest in Berkshire's investment moves. Apple still soaks up more than a fifth of Berkshire's stock portfolio, and Alphabet is now a top-10 position, even if it remains modest in dollar terms compared with the conglomerate's very largest holdings. But when I think about which Buffett stock I most want to ride with for the next decade, I keep coming back to a more old-fashioned name. American Express ( AXP +2.64% ) is Berkshire's second largest equity holding and one of its longest-tenured relationships. For me, it captures the heart of Buffett's approach: a durable franchise, advantaged economics, and a business capable of sending real cash back to owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases . Image source: Getty Images. As of the end of Q3, Berkshire owned 151.6 million American Express shares, valued at about $50 billion. That stake accounts for close to a fifth of Berkshire's equity portfolio, firmly entrenching American Express as Buffett's No. 2 holding behind Apple. Unlike the Apple position, which Berkshire has been trimming, the American Express stake has remained unchanged for decades. That kind of stability reflects the underlying business. American Express is a global payments company that issues cards, runs its own network, and works directly with merchants. Sitting on both sides of the transaction, it captures rich data on where and how card members spend, which helps the company target high-spending customers and refine rewards in ways rivals struggle to match. The company's last full calendar year demonstrates how powerful that model can be. In 2024, American Express's revenue rose 9% year over year to $65.9 billion, and earnings per share climbed 25% to $14.01. Additionally, management reported record card member spending, record fee revenue (the revenue the company collects from membership fees from its customers), and record new card acquisitions. During the same year, it returned $7.9 billion to shareholders through $5.9 billion of share repurchases and $2.0 billion of dividends. Recent quarters show that momentum has not faded. Second-quarter revenue grew 9% year over year, while earnings per share increased 17%. And third-quarter revenue growth accelerated to a rate of 11%. Earnings per share for the quarter also accelerated, rising 19% year over year. Benefitting the quarter was a refresh to its consumer and business Platinum cards in the U.S. \"The initial customer demand and engagement exceeded our expectations, with new U.S. Platinum account acquisitions doubling compared to pre-refresh levels,\" said American Express CEO Stephen Squeri in the company's third-quarter earnings release. The successful refresh of the platinum card speaks to the company's pricing power, as it commands an annual fee of $895 -- a fee members eagerly pay to get access to airport lounges and a long list of other perks, including credits for travel, clothes, dining, and more. And valuation is where American Express really stands out among Buffett's big bets. The stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 24. While financial stocks often sport lower price-to-earnings multiples than stocks in other sectors, it's still notably below both Apple and Alphabet's price-to-earnings ratios of 36 and 30, respectively. Sure, American Express is not cheap compared with many traditional financial stocks, but that multiple looks more reasonable given its consistent double-digit revenue growth, strong credit performance, and shareholder-friendly capital returns. The risks, of course, are significant. A meaningful recession could slow card member spending and push credit losses higher, which would crimp earnings and reduce the company's ability to keep growing capital returns at the same pace. Further, competition from banks, buy-now-pay-later providers, and the big card networks remains intense. Overall, I believe the stock looks attractive despite these risks. Sure, shares could get hit pretty hard in a weak economy. So, anyone who buys the stock today should prepare for volatility and should maintain a long-term view. But I truly believe that, 10 years from now, hindsight will show this as one of Berkshire's best-performing stocks. American Express is an advertising partner of Motley Fool Money.

Here's how you can be a savvy shopper.", "time": "2025-11-24 06:00:19", "full_text": "Oops, something went wrong Black Friday officially hits on Friday 28 November but, as ever, retailers have been building up to the big day since early November. If you take the right approach to finding bargains during the sale, this can be a fantastic opportunity to save money on Christmas presents and special gifts for yourself. However, if you fall foul of the deadly Black Friday mistakes, you can end up wasting hundreds of pounds. It's not our fault that it’s so easy to overspend on the day. There’s a whole industry devoted to getting us to part with our money, and they have a number of dastardly tricks up their sleeves. It’s worth knowing what retailers are up to, so you can protect yourself. You may already have been hoodwinked by a couple of their sales techniques. Retailers have been sending emails and posting endlessly on social media about the fabulous bargains on offer. This isn’t just them helpfully letting you know about deals. They’re repeatedly sending you the message that this event is unmissable. It can make you feel you have to join in and buy something, even if there’s nothing you really need. Read more: 15 ways to save money when you're single Another common tactic is to push out deals early, and then provide an extra discount on the day. They’re hoping that the excitement as the clock ticks down to Friday will prove too much, and you’ll buy before their deepest discounts are unveiled. If you wait for the day itself, take care not to be drawn in by another technique where they have a limited number of items on sale, sometimes only for a very short period of time. This creates the idea of scarcity, so we rush into making a purchase without shopping around or giving it enough thought. Some retailers will take advantage of the fact we’re in a hurry so may not shop around. They’ll charge more for an item for a period before Black Friday, and then mark it up with a big discount on the day. It means they can offer a huge price cut – and yet it might still be cheaper elsewhere. Others will take the opportunity to shift old stock. If you’re not desperate for the latest version, it’s a great chance to save by buying an old model. However, don’t fall into the trap of comparing prices against those of something newer. Check exactly what’s on sale. The other risk is that you’re persuaded to trade up, because they’re offering a deal on the luxury model. If you need something top-of-the-range, then this is a saving, but if you were perfectly happy with the basic model, you could end up paying more for features you’ll never use. The best way to protect yourself from all of these risks is to go in with a game plan. Make a list of everything you definitely need – either for yourself or as Christmas presents. If it’s a gadget or technology, make a note of the model you’re after or the features you need.

Second charge mortgages are mortgages taken out alongside an original mortgage but with a different lender on different terms. According to the Finance and Leasing Association, the number of Brits taking out this type of finance was 12% higher in the eight months to August 2025 than the same period in 2024. “The market has grown sharply over the past two years, with total second charge lending up 16% year-on-year in 2024, reaching £1.7bn, and climbing a further 22% in 2025 up to October,” says Chris Meadows, managing director, second charge loans at Fluent Money. Part of the reason for this growth is the climate of the UK mortgage market. Many people have fixed on low-rate mortgage deals with high early repayment charges and want to secure additional lending without losing these competitive rates or having to pay a penalty. “Second charge mortgages are most suitable if you want to borrow a substantial amount, have decent equity in your property, and don’t want to or can’t remortgage,” says Fiona Peake, mortgages expert at Ocean Finance. Second charge mortgages are similar to standard mortgages in that they are a loan secured against your home. It's an additional loan alongside your existing mortgage and is a way to borrow against your home's equity without changing your primary mortgage “A second-charge mortgage can be useful if you want to access extra cash and are comfortable having a second mortgage,” says Karen Barrett, founder of financial advice platform Unbiased. They are a specialist product and don’t tend to be available via high street lenders. That said, there is still plenty of choice in the market. “You'll be looking at around 20 to 30 in this space with the top players being the likes of United Trust Bank, Step One Finance, West One, Together Money, Norton Finance and Pepper Money,” says John Everest, director of Everest Mortgage Services. Read more: What the autumn budget could mean for the property market Terms can be anything from three to 30 years, depending on how quickly you want to pay your loan off, while rates are very much dependant on a customer’s credit rating and loan-to-value ratio. “Rates are higher than first-charge mortgage rates because the lender is second in line for repayment,” says Richard Dana, founder of mortgage platform Tembo. “Pricing varies by lender, credit profile, equity and income, but broadly falls in the region of 6-9% for strong credit, 9-12% for mid-credit, and higher for adverse-credit cases.” Like first charge mortgages, there’s repayment or interest only options. The main advantage – and the likely reason there’s been such a jump in second charges – is that customers can raise capital without changing the terms of their first mortgage, especially important if they are still lucky enough to be on a low fixed rate. Another advantage is that second charges can be used to raise funds for a host of things, including home improvements, tax bills and debt consolidation; the only purpose you can’t use them for is to pay off gambling debts. “[They] offer more flexible underwriting than traditional remortgages, which can help customers with complex income, bad credit, or non- standard circumstances,” says Meadows.

Another difference with traditional mortgages is the multiples you are able to borrow. “High street lenders typically lend 4.5-5x income; second charge lenders can go 6x plus lending, with one lender in the market that could go to even 8x income in certain cases,” says Everest. Second charges often don’t have any or very large early repayment charges, so you have more flexibility when it comes to settling your debt too. One of the disadvantages of a second charge mortgage are the fees. “With a second charge mortgage, it’s worth stressing that you’ll have to pay fees, and you’ll likely pay more interest overall,” says Barrett. These can include arrangement, legal and broker fees. “Lender’s fees range from 1-2.5% of the initial borrowing amount, however legal costs are usually included. Broker fees are typically higher [than mortgage broker fees], £1500-£3000, [as] the loan sizes are generally smaller than a mortgage,” says Everest. There is also more paperwork than standard loans and a solicitor’s input. “They are not a ‘quick cash’ fix,” flags Peake. “They are more complicated than a personal loan, often requiring consent from your first mortgage lender and involving extra paperwork and legal steps.” You will always need to check that your first charge mortgage lender is comfortable with you taking out a second charge. “Nine out of 10 lenders will require consent; a few lenders do not, for example Halifax. Some lenders in the buy-to-let space do not give consent, therefore you are unable to get a second charge added at all, eg The Mortgage Works,” says Everest. It’s also important to think about whether you will be able to afford to repay two different mortgages and remember your home is at risk if you don’t keep up the repayments on both. “Borrowers take on two secured commitments, which increases overall indebtedness and requires careful affordability assessment,” says Meadows. Second charge mortgages are a specialist financial product and, while you will pay a fee, you should seek the advice of a knowledgeable broker who has experience in the second charge market. “Before taking out a second charge mortgage, make sure the lender is regulated and you understand the repayment schedule… Getting professional advice or working through an experienced mortgage broker is essential, as second charge lending is specialist territory,” says Peake. Second charge mortgages don’t work for every scenario and, often, it makes better financial sense to get a personal loan or to remortgage. If you’re borrowing less than £25,000, a personal loan, even if it has a higher interest rate, it likely to be preferable as it will be simpler to organise and come with fewer fees. “A personal loan may be preferable for smaller borrowing needs, short-term finance, or where the borrower does not want to secure debt against their home,” says Dana. Depending on where you are at with your first mortgage, remortgaging might make more sense. “[This] may be better when the borrower is near the end of a fixed rate, can access a competitive new rate, or wants to simplify finances into one loan at the lowest possible long term cost,” says Dana.

Research compiled in 2024 by the Money and Pensions Service , for example, shows that three in four teachers believe their students do not have the key skills required to manage their money effectively. In a major overhaul of the curriculum, the government is now aiming to close the knowledge gap. Ministers have announced that financial education will be introduced from Key Stage 1 in England’s primary schools, with greater emphasis placed on money management throughout secondary education. The government’s updated curriculum places a far stronger emphasis on financial learning from an early age. The Department for Education said: “Primary pupils will also learn more about the fundamentals of money, recognising that children are now consumers often before they reach secondary school.” Read more: HSBC, Halifax and Barclays cut mortgage rates ahead of budget The reforms also make citizenship compulsory in primary schools, introducing pupils to media and financial literacy, as well as civic understanding, at an early age. The government hopes that business leaders will also embrace the changes. Jane Gratton, of the British Chambers of Commerce, told ministers in a statement that businesses would welcome changes that improve employability. With around 366,000 young people finishing compulsory education each year, monitoring the progress and impact of the updated curriculum is crucial for bringing about real change. Leon Ward, CEO of Money Ready , a financial education charity campaigning for change, told Yahoo Finance UK: “Inclusion in the curriculum is just the first step. The real challenge is making sure it’s delivered consistently, by trained teachers, with resources that actually work.” Ward’s organisation reaches more than 50,000 people each year, from primary pupils to young adults. He has seen first-hand how early intervention can make a difference. “We were thrilled to see financial education front and centre in the curriculum review. Introducing it from Key Stage 1 brings England in line with other UK nations,” said Ward. However, he believes that policy alone won’t be enough and notes that, despite financial education becoming part of the curriculum, provision remains patchy. Teachers need proper funding, training and dedicated time in the school day, he said, adding that without such support, there’s a real risk of repeating the same mistakes. Read more: UK rental growth slows to 5% in October as house prices also lose momentum Money Ready’s Change the Game programme, evaluated over three years by King’s College London , found pupils who received regular lessons through the scheme had financial knowledge scores 5.6% higher than those who didn’t. And all teachers surveyed as part of the programme agreed that financial education was vital, while also flagging that support is essential if it’s going to succeed. “This can’t just be a box-ticking exercise. To really shift the dial, we need to build it into how schools assess and prioritise learning,” Ward added. Research published by Santander this year shows that most 18–21-year-olds lack basic money skills, with 79% having never budgeted, 76% having never paid a bill and 77% never saving for emergencies. Nearly a third rely on TikTok influencers for financial advice, while only 17% say they’ve received guidance from their bank. Eighteen-year-old Aimee, who lives in south-west England and chose not to give her last name, took part in a Money Ready financial education session. Like most of those surveyed by Santander, she had never budgeted, paid a bill or saved for an emergency. She told Yahoo Finance UK she had almost no understanding of how to manage money. “As a young person with extremely limited financial knowledge, I was terrified to go into the adult world, not even knowing how to budget, never mind paying rent and water bills,” she said. Aimee said the session was nothing like the formal lecture she’d expected. “I needed to take a course, obviously. My personal spending wasn’t great. But talking through why I spent so much money on takeaways was such an easy and natural conversation that I never felt embarrassed to talk about my money struggles,” she said. Through the non-judgmental session, she learned in detail about loans and credit, APR, payday loans, buy now, pay later schemes and taxes. This year, research from Yorkshire Building Society showed strong parental support for earlier financial education, with 89% saying money skills should be taught in school. The study also found that one in 10 parents never discuss money with their children, and only 24% do so at least once a week. Read more: UK inflation rate falls for first time in five months to 3.6% in October For Ward, it’s also about empowerment. “If we get this right, we won’t just prevent financial mistakes—we’ll build a generation that feels confident and in control of their future,” he said. Becoming financially literate is something that Aimee would encourage every young person to do – and if the new curriculum is successful, they’ll soon get their chance “Financial education is paramount to living independently. Just knowing how to budget can make all the difference,” Aimee added.

{"company": "AAPL", "title": "Prediction: Taiwan Semiconductor Will Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030", "publisher": "Motley Fool", "link": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/24/prediction-taiwan-semicondcutor-will-be-worth-more/", "summary": "The AI megatrend is benefiting Taiwan Semiconductor in a big way.", "time": "2025-11-24 12:00:00", "full_text": "The AI megatrend is benefiting Taiwan Semiconductor in a big way. At the time of this writing, Apple ( AAPL +1.78% ) is the world's second-largest company by market cap, with a $4 trillion valuation. So, predicting that a much smaller company like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( TSM 0.96% ) can grow to become larger than Apple is a bold claim, especially when you consider that Taiwan Semi is a $1.4 trillion company right now. However, after looking at growth rates for the industries in which it's involved, I think Taiwan Semiconductor can achieve this feat, making it an incredible stock pick over the next few years. I think Taiwan Semi could grow to become a larger company than Apple by 2030, but it's going to need a lot of help to accomplish that goal. Image source: Getty Images. Apple doesn't need a lot of introduction. It's a leader in consumer electronics, and there's a good chance that this article is being read from an Apple-powered device. But therein lies the largest issue with Apple: market saturation. Apple has failed to grow revenue at a meaningful pace over the past few years, and it has only had one reported quarter of double-digit revenue growth since mid-2022 (and it only achieved that mark if you round up). AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts Apple has done a great job repurchasing shares and decreasing expenses, which has allowed its diluted earnings per share (EPS) to grow in the low-double-digit range. As a result, we'll use 12% as Apple's long-term EPS growth rate. For Taiwan Semiconductor, it's at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Its chips are being used in nearly every high-powered AI computing device, ranging from Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) to custom AI accelerators from Broadcom . Furthermore, Taiwan Semiconductor is launching new chip technology that promises to improve energy consumption by 25% to 30% when configured for the same speed as previous generations. That's game-changing technology, and allows TSMC to charge a premium for those chips. Furthermore, there are no signs of the AI race slowing down. The other day, AMD released its projection that it expects its data center division to grow revenue at a 60% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030. That aligns well with a previous projection given by Nvidia, where global data center capital expenditures are expected to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to between $3 trillion and $4 trillion by 2030. That indicates a 42% CAGR at the midpoint, showcasing that TSMC's chip business can easily grow at that rate as well. During Q3, Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue rose 41% in U.S. dollars, aligning with the broader market growth. That aligned with TSMC's net income growth as well, so I'll use a 40% EPS growth rate for this projection. While that may seem like an aggressive assumption, it's what's required for TSMC to surpass Apple in market share by 2030. If the AI data center market is as large as the AMD and Nvidia projections, then this assumption may not be unreasonable. If Apple can grow its EPS by 12% throughout 2030 and Taiwan Semiconductor's rises by 40%, that would result in Apple having $13.52 in diluted EPS by the end of 2030 and Taiwan Semiconductor having a jaw-dropping $57.08. That's a substantial increase from today's values. AAPL EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YCharts To find out how much that would be worth for each company, we need to multiply the EPS figure by the total number of shares outstanding. Then, we'll have to assign it an earnings multiple. Using today's valuation figures (Apple at 36 times earnings and Taiwan Semiconductor at 28), that would give Apple a market cap of $7.2 trillion and Taiwan Semiconductor a market cap of $8.3 trillion by 2030. Will that happen? I'm not sure. Those are massive growth assumptions baked into Taiwan Semiconductor's stock that may not pan out. But if they do, I think it has a strong chance of surpassing Apple in market cap by 2030. Keithen Drury has positions in Broadcom, Nvidia, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
