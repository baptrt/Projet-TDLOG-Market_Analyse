Over the last 60 years, Warren Buffett has built Berkshire Hathaway into one of the most successful investment firms in history. Berkshire's long-term compound annual gain of 20% is nearly double that of the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC +0.54% ) -- underscoring the brilliance of Buffett's approach to portfolio management. Let's explore the types of stocks Buffett tends to buy. From there, I'll reveal which quantum computing stock I think the Oracle of Omaha might be eyeing for Berkshire's next big splash. Warren Buffett has an estimated net worth of over $100 billion. While this level of wealth might suggest the acclaimed investor is a stock-picking genius, Buffett's investment philosophy is simple, straightforward, and can be implemented by anyone. Image source: The Motley Fool. First and foremost, Buffett is a contrarian . The Oracle has never been one to follow the crowd or blindly buy into hype narratives. In his eyes, these dynamics often create overstretched valuations -- leaving unsuspecting investors holding the bag after the euphoria inevitably cools off. Some of Berkshire's largest positions include Apple , American Express , Bank of America , Coca-Cola , and Chevron . The first takeaway from this sub-set of holdings is that Buffett is diversified -- covering consumer electronics, financial services, consumer goods, and energy. The bigger takeaway, however, is that each of these companies has built strong brand appeal in their respective industries. In addition, all of these companies produce goods and services that are in demand during any economic cycle -- adding a layer of business resiliency and relative predictability during more turbulent economic periods. Against this backdrop, these blue chip giants consistently generate heaps of cash flow which are then reinvested back into the business or paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends or stock buybacks . One industry that is somewhat muted in Berkshire's portfolio is technology. Broadly speaking, technology stocks command higher valuation multiples compared to businesses in other sectors. Moreover, given how quickly technology changes, it's difficult to confidently project which industry leaders today will remain prominent and relevant decades into the future. With that said, Berkshire has allocated some capital toward technology stocks -- in particular, artificial intelligence (AI). Beyond, Apple, Berkshire's most direct exposure to AI is from its positions in Amazon and Alphabet . The common theme among these members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is that each has built a formidable ecosystem. Apple has achieved an unparalleled level of customer lock in through its combination of hardware and services -- making switching to competing platforms , like Android, virtually unthinkable. Over the last 20 years, Amazon has evolved into the de facto marketplace for online shopping. The company has used its success from e-commerce to enter new domains including cloud infrastructure, advertising, logistics, groceries, and even AI robotics. In a similar fashion, Alphabet was first known for its affiliation with internet search. Given the stickiness of Google and YouTube, Alphabet has been able to use its product expertise to create new services -- many of which are now pertinent to the company's AI efforts. It's not surprising that each of these tech behemoths generate steady cash flow, which has been used to reward shareholders, as well as ignite innovation roadmaps. Image source: Getty Images. My prediction is that Berkshire is going to acquire a stake in Nvidia ( NVDA 1.83% ) in the near future. Like Buffett's other tech positions, Nvidia has a brand moat for semiconductors and AI infrastructure. Moreover, the company pays a modest dividend is also using its record profits to buy back stock . Furthermore, Nvidia also has a ecosystem -- just like Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon. Nvidia builds the backbone for generative AI development, provides critical data center networking equipment, and is playing an important role in hybrid classical-quantum computing environments . Taken together, Nvidia's diversification positions the company as an established, durable leader set up for further growth as the AI storyline evolves from hardware, software, and the next trillion-dollar wave of quantum AI . Right now, Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 24. While this may be considered a bit of a premium for Berkshire's standards, it's the cheapest Nvidia stock has been in over a year. That's an important nuance to understand given Nvidia's revenue and profits continue to accelerate, all while the company's addressable market continues to expand . It's important for investors to realize that AI and accompanying exposure to quantum computing is likely only part of the reason Berkshire would consider a position in Nvidia. Nevertheless, I think Nvidia checks off many of Berkshire's investment criteria and see the stock as a no-brainer opportunity to buy and hold as the AI narrative continues to unfold.

{"company": "TSLA", "title": "Ranking the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy for 2026: Here's My No. 3 Pick", "publisher": "Motley Fool", "link": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/30/ranking-magnificent-seven-stocks-buy-2026-nvidia/", "summary": "Nvidia remains the best overall AI stock for investors to buy in 2026.", "time": "2025-11-30 18:30:00", "full_text": "Nvidia remains the best overall AI stock for investors to buy in 2026. Welcome to part five of a seven-article series in which I rank the best \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks to buy for 2026 (in reverse order). Tesla came in last , followed by Apple as the sixth pick , Amazon at No. 5 , Alphabet in the fourth spot , and now Nvidia ( NVDA 1.81% ) winning the bronze. Microsoft and Meta Platforms will go head-to-head for the heavyweight title in two separate upcoming articles. While Tesla and Apple are not worth buying right now, I believe Amazon, Alphabet, Nvidia, and then Meta Platforms and Microsoft are. Here's why Nvidia remains one of the best growth stocks to buy in 2026, even after soaring over tenfold over the last three years. Image source: Nvidia. One of the most challenging investment decisions is whether to buy a stock that has skyrocketed in value. Especially a stock like Nvidia, which has gone from being an industry leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) for professional visualization, gaming, automotive, and cryptocurrency mining to completely switching gears and getting the vast majority of its operating income from data centers. Nvidia was well positioned to capitalize on the surge in artificial intelligence (AI) spending. But what's arguably more impressive is what the company has done since the boom began in early 2023. Nvidia continues to push the limits of data center efficiency with its Blackwell GPU and associated hardware and software. In its latest quarter, Nvidia announced that it has become the largest networking business in the world -- with networking revenue up 264% over the past year. In fact, Nvidia's networking business generated more revenue in third-quarter fiscal 2026 than gaming and AI PC, professional visualization, and automotive and robotics combined . During its Nov. 19 earnings call , Nvidia said that demand continues to outpace its GPU supply, signaling strong potential growth for years to come. In late October, Nvidia announced $500 billion in AI chip orders for Blackwell and its upcoming Rubin GPUs. That includes both booked orders and revenue that will be realized through the end of fiscal 2026. On the Nov. 19 earnings call, Nvidia stated that it will likely be taking more orders, so there's an opportunity for the $500 billion number to increase. Nvidia's surging earnings and investor optimism are fueling its red-hot stock price. And there's reason to believe that can continue, given Nvidia's upbeat forecast and its sky-high operating margins , despite competition from Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices . The only reason the stock isn't higher on my Magnificent Seven list is that Microsoft and Meta Platforms are also high-margin companies with multiple avenues for steady growth in the coming years. Nvidia could capitalize on its upcoming orders and then be vulnerable to a pullback in AI spending, given that essentially the entire investment thesis now hinges on compute and networking demand. Still, Nvidia isn't overvalued. At 38.5 times forward earnings estimates , Nvidia is cheaper than Walmart and Costco Wholesale . Find out how I rank the two remaining Magnificent Seven names in my upcoming rankings . Daniel Foelber has positions in Nvidia. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Advanced Micro Devices, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Costco Wholesale, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, and Walmart.

{"company": "TSLA", "title": "D-Wave Quantum Just Issued a $43 Million Warning to Wall Street", "publisher": "Motley Fool", "link": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/12/01/d-wave-quantum-just-issued-a-43-million-warning-to/", "summary": "Executives at D-Wave Quantum are cashing out their stock.", "time": "2025-12-01 05:00:00", "full_text": "Executives at D-Wave Quantum are cashing out their stock. Perhaps the most dominant theme in the stock market over the last three years is the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Seemingly overnight, technology giants such as Microsoft , Alphabet , Amazon , Tesla , and Meta Platforms pivoted their respective business models to go all in on artificial intelligence. Now that we're three years into the AI revolution, a new chapter is starting to be written. Investors are increasingly looking for the next breakthrough, and an emerging technology called quantum computing seems to be the lead candidate for AI's next megatrend. D-Wave Quantum ( QBTS +1.12% ) is a pure-play quantum AI stock whose shares have rocketed by 677% over the last year -- absolutely trouncing the gains seen in Nvidia , the S&P 500 , and the Nasdaq Composite . Despite its performance, D-Wave's leadership just sent a $43 million warning to investors. Is now a good time to sell your D-Wave stock? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. The algorithms that run classical computing are written in long lines of binary bits coded in 0's and 1's. Quantum computers also use this structure; however, the underlying codebase can process algorithms in multiple places at one time through a property known as superposition. Given these characteristics, the code in quantum computers are referred to as qubits (quantum bits). The underlying theory is that quantum computers can process extremely sophisticated datasets at much faster speeds and higher precision compared to today's most powerful supercomputers. Should these breakthroughs come to fruition, quantum computers could revolutionize critical services including modeling energy patterns, sophisticated financial simulations, cryptography, logistics, drug discovery, and more. Given the variety and importance of quantum AI's use cases, it's not surprising that management consulting firm McKinsey & Company is forecasting this technology to add up to $2 trillion in economic value by 2035. Given the exploratory nature of quantum computing, there are quite a few dense physics terms that are often thrown around by the executives leading these companies. D-Wave focuses on quantum annealing, which is a technique that computers can use to run a number of simulations at once and then gradually identify the best solution. These systems rely on superconducting qubits . Broadly speaking, D-Wave's technology can be used in optimization-oriented applications such as analyzing traffic routes. Given the analysis above, it would appear that investing in quantum computing stocks could potentially yield multibagger returns for your portfolio. However, despite the company's promises, D-Wave CEO Alan Baratz has been selling stock like there is no tomorrow. Between May and November, Baratz sold over $43 million in stock. Per the Form 4 filings, his sale on Nov. 11 for roughly $23.3 million was part of a 10b5-1(c) plan. This means the sale was pre-determined. However, the rest of Baratz's stock sales over the last several months appear to be deliberate and not part of a pre-arranged agreement. Taking this one step further, D-Wave's Chief Financial Officer (CFO), John Markovich, as well as several members of the company's board of directors , have also been selling stock over the last six months or so. QBTS data by YCharts To me, it does not signal confidence when leadership uses momentum to cash out their stock at a premium. If they were so confident about D-Wave's future, then why are they collectively selling stock now when prices are soaring? I think that retail investors are falling for the idea that quantum computing could be the next big thing, and unfortunately, many are buying the shares that these corporate executives are unloading. All told, if I owned D-Wave stock, I would consider selling at this time. The stock still trades at a lofty valuation that it likely won't be able to sustain in the long run. Against this backdrop, now may be a good time to consider exiting a position in D-Wave and rotating your capital into more diversified AI and quantum computing stocks within big tech. This approach provides investors with exposure to established AI leaders and a more insulated display of quantum computing without being overly vulnerable to this speculative movement.

The biggest of the big keep getting bigger. That's been the story for the stock market in recent years. The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks now have a combined market cap of over $21 trillion. I suspect this trend will continue. I'll even step out on a limb and make a prediction: Each of these five stocks will be worth more than $8 trillion by 2030. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia ( NVDA 1.83% ) is the easiest pick to join the $8 trillion club within the next five years. The chipmaker's market cap already stands at $4.3 trillion. Nvidia would need to deliver average annual returns of slightly above 13% to reach a valuation of $8 trillion. In my view, two things need to happen for Nvidia to hit this threshold. First, the company must maintain its lead in the GPU market. Second, the demand for AI chips must continue to grow. I think these prerequisites will be met. Sure, Nvidia faces challengers. However, I agree with the company's recent post on X that it's \"a generation ahead of the industry.\" As for the demand for AI chips, I believe we're still in the early stages of growth. Anyone who thought that Apple ( AAPL +0.46% ) would be left behind in the dust might be reconsidering their opinion now. The iPhone maker's shares have rebounded strongly since April. Apple's market cap now tops $4 trillion. Can Apple really double its valuation by the end of the decade? I think so. The company more than doubled its market over the last five years. I predict that Apple will be able to do it again. A sustained iPhone upgrade super cycle could be just what Apple needs to reach a market cap of $8 trillion by 2030. A rumored foldable iPhone would likely push many customers to upgrade their phones. Expanded generative AI functionality could also help. However, I think a launch of top-tier smart glasses that integrate with new iPhone models is the most likely catalyst for a multi-year upgrade super cycle. Alphabet ( GOOG 0.05% ) ( GOOGL +0.06% ) takes the No. 3 and the No. 4 spots on the list because the tech giant has two share classes . With a current market cap of around $3.8 trillion, Google's parent company isn't far behind Apple. Google Cloud is Alphabet's fastest-growing unit. As such, it's the most important driver to push the company to a market cap of $8 trillion by 2030. The same AI demand that will serve as a major tailwind for Nvidia will also benefit Google Cloud. But I expect Alphabet's advertising revenue and profits from Google Search, YouTube, and other apps will also grow significantly over the next five years. The company has two potential lottery tickets as well. Its Waymo unit is the leader in autonomous ride-hailing and has tremendous growth prospects. Google Quantum AI could open up a massive opportunity for Alphabet in quantum computing . Not long ago, Microsoft ( MSFT +1.34% ) reigned as the largest company in the world. It no longer holds that position, but it is within striking distance, with a market cap of $3.6 trillion. The obvious path for Microsoft to get to $8 trillion is for the AI boom to continue unabated. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform would be a huge beneficiary from this trend. I think agentic AI presents an especially significant opportunity for Microsoft, both for Azure and the company's productivity software suite. Don't overlook Microsoft's potential in quantum computing. If the company's topoconductors – a new type of material that isn't a solid, liquid, or gas, but is instead a topological state – fulfill their potential, Microsoft could become one of the biggest quantum computing winners.

{"company": "AAPL", "title": "Warren Buffett Is Rapidly Selling Apple Stock. Here Are 2 Reasons Why.", "publisher": "Motley Fool", "link": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/12/01/warren-buffett-is-rapidly-selling-apple-stock-here/", "summary": "Apple remains Buffett's biggest bet -- for now.", "time": "2025-12-01 10:23:00", "full_text": "Apple remains Buffett's biggest bet -- for now. For nearly a decade, Apple ( AAPL +0.46% ) has been a mainstay in Berkshire Hathaway 's ( BRK.A +0.29% ) ( BRK.B +0.51% ) portfolio. In 2016, Warren Buffett first approved of adding Apple shares, initiating a $1 billion purchase. In the years that followed, Berkshire continued to add more and more Apple stock. At one point, the company's position was valued at more than $100 billion -- its biggest bet ever. Apparently, Buffett and his lieutenants are quickly souring on the stock. In six of the last eight quarters, Berkshire has sold down its stake. And while it remains Berkshire's biggest holding, Apple investors are left wondering: Why is Buffett seemingly selling his Apple stake as quickly as possible? There are two likely reasons, one of which may surprise you. It isn't just Apple stock that Buffett is selling. Many of his key positions have been trimmed in 2025. And right now, Berkshire Hathaway is holding on to more cash than it ever has in its history. Roughly one-third of its entire market cap is now tied up in cash. It's hard not to conclude that Buffett isn't a huge fan of market valuations right now. That's because he has long warned against holding cash. \"Cash is always a bad investment,\" he said in 2009. \"When people say 'cash is king,' that's crazy ... It was sure to go down in value over time.\" He went on to say that he actively avoids holding too much cash: You don't need to have excessive amounts of it around. Anytime we have surplus cash around, I'm unhappy. I would much rather have good businesses than cash. So why is Buffett holding so much cash at Berkshire? There is only one reasonable conclusion: He is having a tough time finding enough deals to absorb Berkshire's growing cash hoard. Right now, stock market valuations are near historic highs. The S&P 500 , for instance, trades above 30 times earnings, something it has done only a few times over the past three decades. So although Apple has been on the chopping block, the selling may deal with more than the company's valuation. But on that front, Buffett may have worries as well. Image source: Berkshire Hathaway. When Buffett started buying Apple stock, shares traded with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio below 3. On a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis, shares traded below a ratio of 12. Today, Apple trades above 10 times sales, with a P/E of nearly 40. All of this occurred as Apple's market cap soared from well under $1 trillion to more than $4 trillion, a reality that would theoretically make future growth harder to come by. AAPL data by YCharts. There's just one problem with this high valuation: The company's growth has slowed dramatically compared to the past. While revenue increases have varied over time, they regularly reached 10% or more from 2012 to 2022. In 2023 and 2024, however, Apple's revenue growth briefly dipped into the negatives. This year, sales gains are expected to be just 8.8%, with estimates calling for only 6.2% next year. To be sure, Apple is still a high quality business with a strong moat and cash flow profile. Sales are still rising, too, just not as quickly as in the past. But that valuation looks to have become a bit out of control, a view that Buffett seemingly agrees with now.
