The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools. Co-founder and CEO Sal Sferlazza said in a statement that as opposed to legacy tech, NinjaOne's \"multi-tenant-native architecture can innovate faster\" to generate several software solutions at once. The company snagged a   after a $500 million funding round led by Iconiq Growth and CapitalG,  's venture capital arm, in February 2025. Matarese said customers, which include IT departments and managed service providers, have reported a 50% reduction in endpoint management and support costs and a 20% boost in staff retention after adopting NinjaOne. \"About 75% of our customers replace four tools or more when they use Ninja,\" he said. \"The less tools you have, the more everything is unified, the better everything works.\" He added that the company expects another 60% to 70% in revenue growth for 2026 and plans to launch five to six additional products over the next year, some of which may incorporate  . Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead.  Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition. In October, NinjaOne rolled out its  , which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow. \"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"",

Stord is part of a crowded market of startups that provide logistics and fulfillment services to online businesses, including ShipBob, Flexport's Deliverr,   and Shipmonk.

                "full_text": "The Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth. Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

                "full_text": "The Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth. Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools.

Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead.  Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition. In October, NinjaOne rolled out its  , which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow. \"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"",

                "full_text": "Software startup NinjaOne has surpassed $500 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR, the company announced Tuesday. The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools. Co-founder and CEO Sal Sferlazza said in a statement that as opposed to legacy tech, NinjaOne's \"multi-tenant-native architecture can innovate faster\" to generate several software solutions at once. The company snagged a   after a $500 million funding round led by Iconiq Growth and CapitalG,  's venture capital arm, in February 2025. Matarese said customers, which include IT departments and managed service providers, have reported a 50% reduction in endpoint management and support costs and a 20% boost in staff retention after adopting NinjaOne. \"About 75% of our customers replace four tools or more when they use Ninja,\" he said. \"The less tools you have, the more everything is unified, the better everything works.\" He added that the company expects another 60% to 70% in revenue growth for 2026 and plans to launch five to six additional products over the next year, some of which may incorporate  . Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead.  Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition. In October, NinjaOne rolled out its  , which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow. \"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"",

                "full_text": "The Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth. Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

The deal, which closed Jan. 1 for a undisclosed amount, adds 12 new locations to Stord's growing logistics network and about 60 new employees. Shipwire is an AI fulfillment platform used by e-commerce firms.  \"This is a great network, great customers, great team to pull onto our technology and our combined scale,\" CEO Sean Henry told CNBC. \"And with that scale, it spins our flywheel up.\" The deal also brings dozens of new large and mid-market customers and a host of AI-powered internal execution, planning and routing tools to Stord's network, he added.  Stord will look to partner with CEVA's 120 million square foot network across 170 countries. This is the seventh acquisition from the Atlanta-based startup that's challenging e-commerce giants such as   by building out a network of infrastructure to help lower shipping costs and speed up deliveries for smaller merchants.  Stord is part of a crowded market of startups that provide logistics and fulfillment services to online businesses, including ShipBob, Flexport's Deliverr,   and Shipmonk.  Demand for these services has only continued to grow as more consumers shop online, and as merchants increasingly operate storefronts on multiple platforms.  Amazon has sought to capitalize on the trend by offering a competing service that lets businesses tap into its network to ship orders placed on other sites, called  . Stord has been on an expansion spree. In May, Stord bought third-party delivery company and   subsidiary Ware2Go for an undisclosed amount earlier this year.

Henry told CNBC that the company is looking to make more acquisitions like Shipwire over the coming months and is eyeing expansions into Australia and Asia. Stord's   includes facilities in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and the Netherlands.  Last year, Stord raised $200 million at $1.5 billion valuation. Major investors include Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund,   Ventures and Strike Capital. Stord was founded in 2015 by 18-year-old Henry, who dropped out of the Georgia Institute of Technology to pursue the prestigious Thiel Fellowship, which was founded by Peter Thiel.

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools. Co-founder and CEO Sal Sferlazza said in a statement that as opposed to legacy tech, NinjaOne's \"multi-tenant-native architecture can innovate faster\" to generate several software solutions at once. The company snagged a   after a $500 million funding round led by Iconiq Growth and CapitalG,  's venture capital arm, in February 2025. Matarese said customers, which include IT departments and managed service providers, have reported a 50% reduction in endpoint management and support costs and a 20% boost in staff retention after adopting NinjaOne. \"About 75% of our customers replace four tools or more when they use Ninja,\" he said. \"The less tools you have, the more everything is unified, the better everything works.\" He added that the company expects another 60% to 70% in revenue growth for 2026 and plans to launch five to six additional products over the next year, some of which may incorporate  . Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead.  Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition. In October, NinjaOne rolled out its  , which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow. \"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"",

Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.\" Lecun, 65, added that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved\" after the company was accused of gaming benchmarks to make its   model look more impressive.

Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000.

The deal, which closed Jan. 1 for a undisclosed amount, adds 12 new locations to Stord's growing logistics network and about 60 new employees. Shipwire is an AI fulfillment platform used by e-commerce firms.  \"This is a great network, great customers, great team to pull onto our technology and our combined scale,\" CEO Sean Henry told CNBC. \"And with that scale, it spins our flywheel up.\" The deal also brings dozens of new large and mid-market customers and a host of AI-powered internal execution, planning and routing tools to Stord's network, he added.

Stord is part of a crowded market of startups that provide logistics and fulfillment services to online businesses, including ShipBob, Flexport's Deliverr,   and Shipmonk.

                "full_text": "The Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth. Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools. Co-founder and CEO Sal Sferlazza said in a statement that as opposed to legacy tech, NinjaOne's \"multi-tenant-native architecture can innovate faster\" to generate several software solutions at once.

Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead.

Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow. \"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"",

                "full_text": "The Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth. Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

His hiring came amid an intensifying  , in which Meta reportedly offered   to poach top talent from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, as it raced other hyperscalers to dominate the multibillion-dollar AI market with the most advanced models. Lecun, who's known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\" and quit Meta in November, called Wang \"young\" and \"inexperienced\" in an interview with the  . \"He learns fast, he knows what he doesn't know,\" Lecun said of Wang, who heads up Meta's new AI research unit TBD Labs and is tasked with building new AI models. But Lecun added: \"There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.\" Lecun, 65, added that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved\" after the company was accused of gaming benchmarks to make its   model look more impressive. Zuckerberg \"basically sidelined the entire Gen AI organization,\" Lecun said. \"A lot of people have left, a lot of people who haven't yet left will leave,\" Lecun added. \"We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,\" he said. \"When you do this, you fall behind.\" CNBC contacted Meta for a response, but had not received a response as this story went live. When asked about Meta's AI hiring drive, Lecun said: \"The future will say whether that was a good idea or not.\" But he added that \"LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence.\" \"I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that,\" Lecun said. Lecun's new startup, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, is focusing on \"world models:\" AI systems that learn from videos and physical data as well as language.  Nabla, a health tech AI startup that partnered with Lecun's company in December, said in a   that, unlike world models, LLMs \"still face some structural constraints, including hallucinations, non-deterministic reasoning and limited handling of continuous multimodal data, which make autonomous decision-making challenging.\"",

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools. Co-founder and CEO Sal Sferlazza said in a statement that as opposed to legacy tech, NinjaOne's \"multi-tenant-native architecture can innovate faster\" to generate several software solutions at once. The company snagged a   after a $500 million funding round led by Iconiq Growth and CapitalG,  's venture capital arm, in February 2025. Matarese said customers, which include IT departments and managed service providers, have reported a 50% reduction in endpoint management and support costs and a 20% boost in staff retention after adopting NinjaOne. \"About 75% of our customers replace four tools or more when they use Ninja,\" he said. \"The less tools you have, the more everything is unified, the better everything works.\" He added that the company expects another 60% to 70% in revenue growth for 2026 and plans to launch five to six additional products over the next year, some of which may incorporate  . Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead.  Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition. In October, NinjaOne rolled out its  , which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow. \"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"",

                "full_text": "The Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth. Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article  former chief AI scientist, Yann Lecun, has called its 29-year-old AI boss \"inexperienced,\" and warned of a staff exodus from the company. Alexander Wang, the billionaire co-founder of Scale AI, joined Meta as its chief AI officer in 2025 after the tech giant bought a 49% stake in his startup.  His hiring came amid an intensifying  , in which Meta reportedly offered   to poach top talent from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, as it raced other hyperscalers to dominate the multibillion-dollar AI market with the most advanced models. Lecun, who's known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\" and quit Meta in November, called Wang \"young\" and \"inexperienced\" in an interview with the  . \"He learns fast, he knows what he doesn't know,\" Lecun said of Wang, who heads up Meta's new AI research unit TBD Labs and is tasked with building new AI models. But Lecun added: \"There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.\" Lecun, 65, added that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved\" after the company was accused of gaming benchmarks to make its   model look more impressive. Zuckerberg \"basically sidelined the entire Gen AI organization,\" Lecun said. \"A lot of people have left, a lot of people who haven't yet left will leave,\" Lecun added. \"We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,\" he said. \"When you do this, you fall behind.\" CNBC contacted Meta for a response, but had not received a response as this story went live. When asked about Meta's AI hiring drive, Lecun said: \"The future will say whether that was a good idea or not.\" But he added that \"LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence.\" \"I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that,\" Lecun said. Lecun's new startup, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, is focusing on \"world models:\" AI systems that learn from videos and physical data as well as language.  Nabla, a health tech AI startup that partnered with Lecun's company in December, said in a   that, unlike world models, LLMs \"still face some structural constraints, including hallucinations, non-deterministic reasoning and limited handling of continuous multimodal data, which make autonomous decision-making challenging.\"",

Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article  former chief AI scientist, Yann Lecun, has called its 29-year-old AI boss \"inexperienced,\" and warned of a staff exodus from the company. Alexander Wang, the billionaire co-founder of Scale AI, joined Meta as its chief AI officer in 2025 after the tech giant bought a 49% stake in his startup.  His hiring came amid an intensifying  , in which Meta reportedly offered   to poach top talent from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, as it raced other hyperscalers to dominate the multibillion-dollar AI market with the most advanced models. Lecun, who's known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\" and quit Meta in November, called Wang \"young\" and \"inexperienced\" in an interview with the  . \"He learns fast, he knows what he doesn't know,\" Lecun said of Wang, who heads up Meta's new AI research unit TBD Labs and is tasked with building new AI models. But Lecun added: \"There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.\" Lecun, 65, added that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved\" after the company was accused of gaming benchmarks to make its   model look more impressive. Zuckerberg \"basically sidelined the entire Gen AI organization,\" Lecun said. \"A lot of people have left, a lot of people who haven't yet left will leave,\" Lecun added. \"We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,\" he said. \"When you do this, you fall behind.\" CNBC contacted Meta for a response, but had not received a response as this story went live. When asked about Meta's AI hiring drive, Lecun said: \"The future will say whether that was a good idea or not.\" But he added that \"LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence.\" \"I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that,\" Lecun said. Lecun's new startup, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, is focusing on \"world models:\" AI systems that learn from videos and physical data as well as language.  Nabla, a health tech AI startup that partnered with Lecun's company in December, said in a   that, unlike world models, LLMs \"still face some structural constraints, including hallucinations, non-deterministic reasoning and limited handling of continuous multimodal data, which make autonomous decision-making challenging.\"",

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools. Co-founder and CEO Sal Sferlazza said in a statement that as opposed to legacy tech, NinjaOne's \"multi-tenant-native architecture can innovate faster\" to generate several software solutions at once. The company snagged a   after a $500 million funding round led by Iconiq Growth and CapitalG,  's venture capital arm, in February 2025. Matarese said customers, which include IT departments and managed service providers, have reported a 50% reduction in endpoint management and support costs and a 20% boost in staff retention after adopting NinjaOne. \"About 75% of our customers replace four tools or more when they use Ninja,\" he said. \"The less tools you have, the more everything is unified, the better everything works.\" He added that the company expects another 60% to 70% in revenue growth for 2026 and plans to launch five to six additional products over the next year, some of which may incorporate  . Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead.  Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition. In October, NinjaOne rolled out its  , which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow. \"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"",

The diffusion index represents the percentage of companies reporting expansion, so anything above 50 indicates growth, albeit at a slower pace in the case of December.

His hiring came amid an intensifying  , in which Meta reportedly offered   to poach top talent from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, as it raced other hyperscalers to dominate the multibillion-dollar AI market with the most advanced models. Lecun, who's known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\" and quit Meta in November, called Wang \"young\" and \"inexperienced\" in an interview with the  . \"He learns fast, he knows what he doesn't know,\" Lecun said of Wang, who heads up Meta's new AI research unit TBD Labs and is tasked with building new AI models. But Lecun added: \"There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.\" Lecun, 65, added that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved\" after the company was accused of gaming benchmarks to make its   model look more impressive. Zuckerberg \"basically sidelined the entire Gen AI organization,\" Lecun said. \"A lot of people have left, a lot of people who haven't yet left will leave,\" Lecun added. \"We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,\" he said. \"When you do this, you fall behind.\" CNBC contacted Meta for a response, but had not received a response as this story went live. When asked about Meta's AI hiring drive, Lecun said: \"The future will say whether that was a good idea or not.\" But he added that \"LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence.\" \"I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that,\" Lecun said. Lecun's new startup, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, is focusing on \"world models:\" AI systems that learn from videos and physical data as well as language.  Nabla, a health tech AI startup that partnered with Lecun's company in December, said in a   that, unlike world models, LLMs \"still face some structural constraints, including hallucinations, non-deterministic reasoning and limited handling of continuous multimodal data, which make autonomous decision-making challenging.\"",

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools.

Mahoney will replace Meta's previous head lawyer, Jennifer Newstead, who announced in December that she would be leaving Meta to become Apple's  in March.  He joins Meta at a time when the company is facing a wave of child-safety related lawsuits around the country. That includes an ongoing case in New Mexico in which the state's attorney general alleged that Meta   from sexual abuse and human trafficking on its apps like Facebook and Instagram. \"C.J. brings world-class legal expertise, passion for frontier technology, and deep insight into the global regulatory challenges facing our industry,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. \"I'm looking forward to working with him to advance Meta's mission to build the future of human connection.\" Most recently, Mahoney was at Microsoft as a corporate vice president and general counsel for product, services and go-to-market legal. He was previously a deputy U.S. trade representative during President Donald Trump's first stint in the White House. He joined Microsoft in 2021 as deputy general counsel and focused on trade and the company's Azure cloud business. Soon after joining, he represented Microsoft during a U.S. House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade hearing, talking about the company's initiatives in Africa. In 2025, Mahoney became Microsoft's general counsel, taking leadership of lawyers, paralegals and business professionals who work on engineering, sales and marketing. At Microsoft, Mahoney reported to Brad Smith, the company's vice chair, president and top executive on legal and political matters, a Microsoft spokesperson said. After Meta's Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, Zuckerberg reached out to Smith for advice,   in 2018.  \"I'm excited to join Meta as it leads the way in AI innovation and continues to connect people around the world,\" Mahoney said in a statement. \"As I close an incredible chapter at Microsoft and begin a new one at Meta, I'm grateful for the trust Mark and the Board have placed in me.\" The Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment on succession planning after Mahoney's departure.

                "full_text": "In this article  has angered some online retailers that say they didn't consent to have their products scraped and listed on the e-commerce giant's sprawling marketplace. In February, the company announced   a feature that lets consumers browse items from other brands' sites on Amazon. Some of those items include a button labeled   an artificial intelligence agent that can purchase products from other websites on a shopper's behalf. Amazon pitched the services, which are in testing phase for some U.S. users, as a way for shoppers to \"find any product they want and need,\" including items that aren't available on its site. Over the past decade, Amazon has increasingly turned to third-party merchants for products, and now says more than 60% of sales on its retail platform are from independent sellers.  In recent weeks, some businesses began to object to their products being sold on Amazon without their permission, according to     and  . Retailers, in some instances, said the program resulted in Amazon listing products that they never sold or that were out of stock. \"Sounds like a great program until the agentic AI starts selling customers things you don't have, all while your shop has no idea it's sending the wrong items to the customer,\" Hitchcock Paper, a Virginia-based stationery shop, said in   in late December.  The paper retailer said it discovered it was part of the program when it began receiving orders for a stress ball product, which it doesn't sell, from a \"buyforme.amazon\" email address.   CEO Angie Chua said she started receiving orders from Amazon's Buy for Me agent last week even though she hadn't opted in to the program. Her company sells stationery and journaling accessories through its   website as well as a storefront in Palm Springs, California. Chua told CNBC that, based on Amazon's instructions in  on its site, she reached out to the company to request that it pull her products. The listings were taken down within a few days, but she said the experience left her feeling \"exploited.\" \"We were forced to be dropshippers on a platform that we have made a conscious decision not to be part of,\" Chua said, referring to an online retail model that involves selling products to shoppers without storing the inventory. More than 180 businesses who sell their goods on Shopify, Squarespace, WooCommerce,   and other platforms have since contacted Chua to share that their products were also listed on Amazon without their permission, she said.  An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC that Shop Direct and Buy for Me help customers find products not sold on its site, \"while helping businesses reach new customers and drive incremental sales,\" and that the programs have \"received positive feedback.\"  \"Businesses can opt out at any time by emailing  , and we remove them from these programs promptly,\" the spokesperson said. The company said product and pricing information are pulled from public information on a brand's website and that Amazon's system checks to make sure the item is in stock and the price is right.  Amazon has said that Buy for Me remains an \"experiment\" and that it doesn't collect a commission when customers use it to make a purchase. In November, the company   the number of products available through Buy for Me had increased from 65,000 at launch to more 500,000. It's all part of Amazon's push into  , a technology that could potentially disrupt how people shop online. Companies including OpenAI,   and Perplexity have released features that allow consumers to purchase products from retailers and online marketplaces without leaving a chatbot window.  Amazon has blocked dozens of agents from accessing its site, while investing in its homegrown AI tools, and in November the company   Perplexity over an agent in the startup's Comet browser that allows it to make purchases on a user's behalf.  In the complaint, Amazon alleged Perplexity took steps to \"conceal\" its agents so they could continue to scrape Amazon's website without its approval. Perplexity called the lawsuit a \"bully tactic.\"  In 2024, Amazon released its own shopping chatbot called Rufus, which now has some agentic capabilities.",

                "full_text": "With fears growing of an investment bubble in artificial intelligence infrastructure, the next phase of AI growth will come from private software companies already creating massive gains in productivity, according to Robert Smith, CEO of Vista Equity Partners. The soaring valuations of  ,  ,  ,  , OpenAI and other hyperscalers and large-language models have dominated the debate over AI opportunities and risks. Yet some of the biggest investment opportunities in AI will be in non-public enterprise software companies that are using specific agents, or \"agentic AI,\"  to perform company tasks, according to Smith, who's also the founder and chairman of Vista. \"AI has sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the air for a lot of investors and pulled them into the Mag 7,\" Smith told CNBC. \"Those hyperscalers are now starting to build out the infrastructure and capability. Some may argue they're overvalued in some respects. But the [next] wave will be the application providers. And that's typically been the way that these cycles have played out. The application providers usually get the lion's share of the economic rent long term, once the technology has been diffused into those markets and diffused into those technologies. That's really where we are in the cycle.\" Vista's aggressive bet on applications and agentic software highlights one of the fastest-growing corners of the AI trade and alternative investments. Unlike the AI infrastructure sector — which includes dozens of publicly traded companies, hyperscalers and LLMs — the vast majority of companies creating AI applications are private. Smith said 97% of enterprise software companies are private. Vista aims to take the lead in the corporate agentic revolution. The private equity firm, with $100 billion in assets under management and over 90 portfolio companies specializing in enterprise software, has created an \"agentic factory\" to deploy AI across its companies and transform their businesses. Smith said 30 of Vista's companies are generating revenue from converting to agentic AI, and another 30 or 40 will convert in the coming months. \"Over two and a half years ago, we built out the infrastructure,\" Smith said. \"Now we have the right partners to do it with: the hyperscalers, who have capacity and technological capability that we can then infuse into each of our companies to make this a reality.\" The Inside Alts newsletter with Robert Frank and Leslie Picker is your guide to the fast-growing world of alternative investments. . One example is a Vista portfolio company called SimplePractice. The company's software helps mental-health professionals, using agents to record sessions, transcribe and draft notes. Another of Vista's companies, called Reslinc, helps companies assess their potential tariff exposure and meet regulatory requirements. Vista's approach challenges the theory that AI will \"eat software,\" as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang famously predicted in 2017. While it may weaken many software-as-a-service companies and allow companies to code and perform many software tasks themselves, agentic AI will accelerate the growth of enterprise software tools that can perform tasks with high levels of accuracy, Smith said. \"AI will enable enterprise software to eat services,\" he said. The gains in productivity and profits from agentic AI are already apparent. Vista's portfolio companies are seeing productivity gains of 30% to 50% in writing code, Smith said. Some tasks that take a person hours to do can be done in seconds with AI, he said. He said 20 cents' worth of \"inference,\" or running an AI model, can lead to up to $10 in savings. While some jobs will be eliminated, of course, Smith said others will be created or reinvented. \"All knowledge workers will be affected in some way,\" he said. \"Some, there will no longer be that job category. For some, it will be a hyper accelerant of their capabilities. I tell people, AI is not going to replace the job in some businesses, but the person using AI will replace your job.\"",

Nvidia's chips are critical for companies developing artificial intelligence models.  We've fired up our supply chain, and H200s are flowing through the line,\" Huang said at a press conference at  .  Investors see the Chinese market as a massive opportunity for Nvidia as the country's tech companies develop their own AI models. Huang has previously said that the market could be worth $50 billion per year, and none of those sales are currently included in Nvidia's forecasts. In December, President Donald Trump said that Nvidia could export its H200 chip to China as long as the company paid 25% of those sales to the U.S. government. The H200 is a generation or two behind the latest Nvidia models, but unlike previous chips that Nvidia was approved to export to China, this model has not been slowed down on purpose to comply with export restrictions. China must also approve the import of Nvidia's chips. Huang on Tuesday said that he is not expecting China to make an announcement that imports have been approved and that Nvidia would know the regulatory status as purchase orders come in.  \"We're not expecting any press releases, or any large declarations,\" Huang said. \"It's just going to be purchase orders.\" Huang added that any H200 sales would be in addition to the   the company provided last year.  \"It appears that we're going to be going back to China,\" Huang said.",

                "full_text": "With fears growing of an investment bubble in artificial intelligence infrastructure, the next phase of AI growth will come from private software companies already creating massive gains in productivity, according to Robert Smith, CEO of Vista Equity Partners. The soaring valuations of  ,  ,  ,  , OpenAI and other hyperscalers and large-language models have dominated the debate over AI opportunities and risks. Yet some of the biggest investment opportunities in AI will be in non-public enterprise software companies that are using specific agents, or \"agentic AI,\"  to perform company tasks, according to Smith, who's also the founder and chairman of Vista. \"AI has sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the air for a lot of investors and pulled them into the Mag 7,\" Smith told CNBC. \"Those hyperscalers are now starting to build out the infrastructure and capability. Some may argue they're overvalued in some respects. But the [next] wave will be the application providers. And that's typically been the way that these cycles have played out. The application providers usually get the lion's share of the economic rent long term, once the technology has been diffused into those markets and diffused into those technologies. That's really where we are in the cycle.\" Vista's aggressive bet on applications and agentic software highlights one of the fastest-growing corners of the AI trade and alternative investments. Unlike the AI infrastructure sector — which includes dozens of publicly traded companies, hyperscalers and LLMs — the vast majority of companies creating AI applications are private. Smith said 97% of enterprise software companies are private. Vista aims to take the lead in the corporate agentic revolution. The private equity firm, with $100 billion in assets under management and over 90 portfolio companies specializing in enterprise software, has created an \"agentic factory\" to deploy AI across its companies and transform their businesses. Smith said 30 of Vista's companies are generating revenue from converting to agentic AI, and another 30 or 40 will convert in the coming months. \"Over two and a half years ago, we built out the infrastructure,\" Smith said. \"Now we have the right partners to do it with: the hyperscalers, who have capacity and technological capability that we can then infuse into each of our companies to make this a reality.\" The Inside Alts newsletter with Robert Frank and Leslie Picker is your guide to the fast-growing world of alternative investments. . One example is a Vista portfolio company called SimplePractice. The company's software helps mental-health professionals, using agents to record sessions, transcribe and draft notes. Another of Vista's companies, called Reslinc, helps companies assess their potential tariff exposure and meet regulatory requirements. Vista's approach challenges the theory that AI will \"eat software,\" as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang famously predicted in 2017. While it may weaken many software-as-a-service companies and allow companies to code and perform many software tasks themselves, agentic AI will accelerate the growth of enterprise software tools that can perform tasks with high levels of accuracy, Smith said. \"AI will enable enterprise software to eat services,\" he said. The gains in productivity and profits from agentic AI are already apparent. Vista's portfolio companies are seeing productivity gains of 30% to 50% in writing code, Smith said. Some tasks that take a person hours to do can be done in seconds with AI, he said. He said 20 cents' worth of \"inference,\" or running an AI model, can lead to up to $10 in savings. While some jobs will be eliminated, of course, Smith said others will be created or reinvented. \"All knowledge workers will be affected in some way,\" he said. \"Some, there will no longer be that job category. For some, it will be a hyper accelerant of their capabilities. I tell people, AI is not going to replace the job in some businesses, but the person using AI will replace your job.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article  has angered some online retailers that say they didn't consent to have their products scraped and listed on the e-commerce giant's sprawling marketplace. In February, the company announced   a feature that lets consumers browse items from other brands' sites on Amazon. Some of those items include a button labeled   an artificial intelligence agent that can purchase products from other websites on a shopper's behalf. Amazon pitched the services, which are in testing phase for some U.S. users, as a way for shoppers to \"find any product they want and need,\" including items that aren't available on its site. Over the past decade, Amazon has increasingly turned to third-party merchants for products, and now says more than 60% of sales on its retail platform are from independent sellers.  In recent weeks, some businesses began to object to their products being sold on Amazon without their permission, according to     and  . Retailers, in some instances, said the program resulted in Amazon listing products that they never sold or that were out of stock. \"Sounds like a great program until the agentic AI starts selling customers things you don't have, all while your shop has no idea it's sending the wrong items to the customer,\" Hitchcock Paper, a Virginia-based stationery shop, said in   in late December.  The paper retailer said it discovered it was part of the program when it began receiving orders for a stress ball product, which it doesn't sell, from a \"buyforme.amazon\" email address.   CEO Angie Chua said she started receiving orders from Amazon's Buy for Me agent last week even though she hadn't opted in to the program. Her company sells stationery and journaling accessories through its   website as well as a storefront in Palm Springs, California. Chua told CNBC that, based on Amazon's instructions in  on its site, she reached out to the company to request that it pull her products. The listings were taken down within a few days, but she said the experience left her feeling \"exploited.\" \"We were forced to be dropshippers on a platform that we have made a conscious decision not to be part of,\" Chua said, referring to an online retail model that involves selling products to shoppers without storing the inventory. More than 180 businesses who sell their goods on Shopify, Squarespace, WooCommerce,   and other platforms have since contacted Chua to share that their products were also listed on Amazon without their permission, she said.  An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC that Shop Direct and Buy for Me help customers find products not sold on its site, \"while helping businesses reach new customers and drive incremental sales,\" and that the programs have \"received positive feedback.\"  \"Businesses can opt out at any time by emailing  , and we remove them from these programs promptly,\" the spokesperson said. The company said product and pricing information are pulled from public information on a brand's website and that Amazon's system checks to make sure the item is in stock and the price is right.  Amazon has said that Buy for Me remains an \"experiment\" and that it doesn't collect a commission when customers use it to make a purchase. In November, the company   the number of products available through Buy for Me had increased from 65,000 at launch to more 500,000. It's all part of Amazon's push into  , a technology that could potentially disrupt how people shop online. Companies including OpenAI,   and Perplexity have released features that allow consumers to purchase products from retailers and online marketplaces without leaving a chatbot window.  Amazon has blocked dozens of agents from accessing its site, while investing in its homegrown AI tools, and in November the company   Perplexity over an agent in the startup's Comet browser that allows it to make purchases on a user's behalf.  In the complaint, Amazon alleged Perplexity took steps to \"conceal\" its agents so they could continue to scrape Amazon's website without its approval. Perplexity called the lawsuit a \"bully tactic.\"  In 2024, Amazon released its own shopping chatbot called Rufus, which now has some agentic capabilities.",

Even before the news broke, headlines about a potential takeover were already circulating. European politicians banded together to stand behind Greenland's borders, while leaders of Denmark and its autonomous territory emphasized the Arctic island's sovereignty.

                "full_text": "With fears growing of an investment bubble in artificial intelligence infrastructure, the next phase of AI growth will come from private software companies already creating massive gains in productivity, according to Robert Smith, CEO of Vista Equity Partners. The soaring valuations of  ,  ,  ,  , OpenAI and other hyperscalers and large-language models have dominated the debate over AI opportunities and risks. Yet some of the biggest investment opportunities in AI will be in non-public enterprise software companies that are using specific agents, or \"agentic AI,\"  to perform company tasks, according to Smith, who's also the founder and chairman of Vista. \"AI has sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the air for a lot of investors and pulled them into the Mag 7,\" Smith told CNBC. \"Those hyperscalers are now starting to build out the infrastructure and capability. Some may argue they're overvalued in some respects. But the [next] wave will be the application providers. And that's typically been the way that these cycles have played out. The application providers usually get the lion's share of the economic rent long term, once the technology has been diffused into those markets and diffused into those technologies. That's really where we are in the cycle.\" Vista's aggressive bet on applications and agentic software highlights one of the fastest-growing corners of the AI trade and alternative investments. Unlike the AI infrastructure sector — which includes dozens of publicly traded companies, hyperscalers and LLMs — the vast majority of companies creating AI applications are private. Smith said 97% of enterprise software companies are private. Vista aims to take the lead in the corporate agentic revolution. The private equity firm, with $100 billion in assets under management and over 90 portfolio companies specializing in enterprise software, has created an \"agentic factory\" to deploy AI across its companies and transform their businesses. Smith said 30 of Vista's companies are generating revenue from converting to agentic AI, and another 30 or 40 will convert in the coming months. \"Over two and a half years ago, we built out the infrastructure,\" Smith said. \"Now we have the right partners to do it with: the hyperscalers, who have capacity and technological capability that we can then infuse into each of our companies to make this a reality.\" The Inside Alts newsletter with Robert Frank and Leslie Picker is your guide to the fast-growing world of alternative investments. . One example is a Vista portfolio company called SimplePractice. The company's software helps mental-health professionals, using agents to record sessions, transcribe and draft notes. Another of Vista's companies, called Reslinc, helps companies assess their potential tariff exposure and meet regulatory requirements. Vista's approach challenges the theory that AI will \"eat software,\" as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang famously predicted in 2017. While it may weaken many software-as-a-service companies and allow companies to code and perform many software tasks themselves, agentic AI will accelerate the growth of enterprise software tools that can perform tasks with high levels of accuracy, Smith said. \"AI will enable enterprise software to eat services,\" he said. The gains in productivity and profits from agentic AI are already apparent. Vista's portfolio companies are seeing productivity gains of 30% to 50% in writing code, Smith said. Some tasks that take a person hours to do can be done in seconds with AI, he said. He said 20 cents' worth of \"inference,\" or running an AI model, can lead to up to $10 in savings. While some jobs will be eliminated, of course, Smith said others will be created or reinvented. \"All knowledge workers will be affected in some way,\" he said. \"Some, there will no longer be that job category. For some, it will be a hyper accelerant of their capabilities. I tell people, AI is not going to replace the job in some businesses, but the person using AI will replace your job.\"",

In February, the company announced   a feature that lets consumers browse items from other brands' sites on Amazon. Some of those items include a button labeled   an artificial intelligence agent that can purchase products from other websites on a shopper's behalf. Amazon pitched the services, which are in testing phase for some U.S. users, as a way for shoppers to \"find any product they want and need,\" including items that aren't available on its site. Over the past decade, Amazon has increasingly turned to third-party merchants for products, and now says more than 60% of sales on its retail platform are from independent sellers.  In recent weeks, some businesses began to object to their products being sold on Amazon without their permission, according to     and  . Retailers, in some instances, said the program resulted in Amazon listing products that they never sold or that were out of stock. \"Sounds like a great program until the agentic AI starts selling customers things you don't have, all while your shop has no idea it's sending the wrong items to the customer,\" Hitchcock Paper, a Virginia-based stationery shop, said in   in late December.  The paper retailer said it discovered it was part of the program when it began receiving orders for a stress ball product, which it doesn't sell, from a \"buyforme.amazon\" email address.   CEO Angie Chua said she started receiving orders from Amazon's Buy for Me agent last week even though she hadn't opted in to the program. Her company sells stationery and journaling accessories through its   website as well as a storefront in Palm Springs, California. Chua told CNBC that, based on Amazon's instructions in  on its site, she reached out to the company to request that it pull her products. The listings were taken down within a few days, but she said the experience left her feeling \"exploited.\" \"We were forced to be dropshippers on a platform that we have made a conscious decision not to be part of,\" Chua said, referring to an online retail model that involves selling products to shoppers without storing the inventory. More than 180 businesses who sell their goods on Shopify, Squarespace, WooCommerce,   and other platforms have since contacted Chua to share that their products were also listed on Amazon without their permission, she said.  An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC that Shop Direct and Buy for Me help customers find products not sold on its site, \"while helping businesses reach new customers and drive incremental sales,\" and that the programs have \"received positive feedback.\"  \"Businesses can opt out at any time by emailing  , and we remove them from these programs promptly,\" the spokesperson said. The company said product and pricing information are pulled from public information on a brand's website and that Amazon's system checks to make sure the item is in stock and the price is right.  Amazon has said that Buy for Me remains an \"experiment\" and that it doesn't collect a commission when customers use it to make a purchase. In November, the company   the number of products available through Buy for Me had increased from 65,000 at launch to more 500,000. It's all part of Amazon's push into  , a technology that could potentially disrupt how people shop online. Companies including OpenAI,   and Perplexity have released features that allow consumers to purchase products from retailers and online marketplaces without leaving a chatbot window.  Amazon has blocked dozens of agents from accessing its site, while investing in its homegrown AI tools, and in November the company   Perplexity over an agent in the startup's Comet browser that allows it to make purchases on a user's behalf.  In the complaint, Amazon alleged Perplexity took steps to \"conceal\" its agents so they could continue to scrape Amazon's website without its approval. Perplexity called the lawsuit a \"bully tactic.\"  In 2024, Amazon released its own shopping chatbot called Rufus, which now has some agentic capabilities.",

The soaring valuations of  ,  ,  ,  , OpenAI and other hyperscalers and large-language models have dominated the debate over AI opportunities and risks. Yet some of the biggest investment opportunities in AI will be in non-public enterprise software companies that are using specific agents, or \"agentic AI,\"  to perform company tasks, according to Smith, who's also the founder and chairman of Vista. \"AI has sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the air for a lot of investors and pulled them into the Mag 7,\" Smith told CNBC. \"Those hyperscalers are now starting to build out the infrastructure and capability. Some may argue they're overvalued in some respects. But the [next] wave will be the application providers. And that's typically been the way that these cycles have played out. The application providers usually get the lion's share of the economic rent long term, once the technology has been diffused into those markets and diffused into those technologies. That's really where we are in the cycle.\" Vista's aggressive bet on applications and agentic software highlights one of the fastest-growing corners of the AI trade and alternative investments. Unlike the AI infrastructure sector — which includes dozens of publicly traded companies, hyperscalers and LLMs — the vast majority of companies creating AI applications are private. Smith said 97% of enterprise software companies are private. Vista aims to take the lead in the corporate agentic revolution. The private equity firm, with $100 billion in assets under management and over 90 portfolio companies specializing in enterprise software, has created an \"agentic factory\" to deploy AI across its companies and transform their businesses. Smith said 30 of Vista's companies are generating revenue from converting to agentic AI, and another 30 or 40 will convert in the coming months. \"Over two and a half years ago, we built out the infrastructure,\" Smith said. \"Now we have the right partners to do it with: the hyperscalers, who have capacity and technological capability that we can then infuse into each of our companies to make this a reality.\" The Inside Alts newsletter with Robert Frank and Leslie Picker is your guide to the fast-growing world of alternative investments. .

Vista's approach challenges the theory that AI will \"eat software,\" as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang famously predicted in 2017. While it may weaken many software-as-a-service companies and allow companies to code and perform many software tasks themselves, agentic AI will accelerate the growth of enterprise software tools that can perform tasks with high levels of accuracy, Smith said. \"AI will enable enterprise software to eat services,\" he said. The gains in productivity and profits from agentic AI are already apparent. Vista's portfolio companies are seeing productivity gains of 30% to 50% in writing code, Smith said. Some tasks that take a person hours to do can be done in seconds with AI, he said. He said 20 cents' worth of \"inference,\" or running an AI model, can lead to up to $10 in savings. While some jobs will be eliminated, of course, Smith said others will be created or reinvented. \"All knowledge workers will be affected in some way,\" he said. \"Some, there will no longer be that job category.

                "full_text": "With fears growing of an investment bubble in artificial intelligence infrastructure, the next phase of AI growth will come from private software companies already creating massive gains in productivity, according to Robert Smith, CEO of Vista Equity Partners. The soaring valuations of  ,  ,  ,  , OpenAI and other hyperscalers and large-language models have dominated the debate over AI opportunities and risks. Yet some of the biggest investment opportunities in AI will be in non-public enterprise software companies that are using specific agents, or \"agentic AI,\"  to perform company tasks, according to Smith, who's also the founder and chairman of Vista. \"AI has sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the air for a lot of investors and pulled them into the Mag 7,\" Smith told CNBC. \"Those hyperscalers are now starting to build out the infrastructure and capability. Some may argue they're overvalued in some respects. But the [next] wave will be the application providers. And that's typically been the way that these cycles have played out. The application providers usually get the lion's share of the economic rent long term, once the technology has been diffused into those markets and diffused into those technologies. That's really where we are in the cycle.\" Vista's aggressive bet on applications and agentic software highlights one of the fastest-growing corners of the AI trade and alternative investments. Unlike the AI infrastructure sector — which includes dozens of publicly traded companies, hyperscalers and LLMs — the vast majority of companies creating AI applications are private. Smith said 97% of enterprise software companies are private. Vista aims to take the lead in the corporate agentic revolution. The private equity firm, with $100 billion in assets under management and over 90 portfolio companies specializing in enterprise software, has created an \"agentic factory\" to deploy AI across its companies and transform their businesses. Smith said 30 of Vista's companies are generating revenue from converting to agentic AI, and another 30 or 40 will convert in the coming months. \"Over two and a half years ago, we built out the infrastructure,\" Smith said. \"Now we have the right partners to do it with: the hyperscalers, who have capacity and technological capability that we can then infuse into each of our companies to make this a reality.\" The Inside Alts newsletter with Robert Frank and Leslie Picker is your guide to the fast-growing world of alternative investments. . One example is a Vista portfolio company called SimplePractice. The company's software helps mental-health professionals, using agents to record sessions, transcribe and draft notes. Another of Vista's companies, called Reslinc, helps companies assess their potential tariff exposure and meet regulatory requirements. Vista's approach challenges the theory that AI will \"eat software,\" as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang famously predicted in 2017. While it may weaken many software-as-a-service companies and allow companies to code and perform many software tasks themselves, agentic AI will accelerate the growth of enterprise software tools that can perform tasks with high levels of accuracy, Smith said. \"AI will enable enterprise software to eat services,\" he said. The gains in productivity and profits from agentic AI are already apparent. Vista's portfolio companies are seeing productivity gains of 30% to 50% in writing code, Smith said. Some tasks that take a person hours to do can be done in seconds with AI, he said. He said 20 cents' worth of \"inference,\" or running an AI model, can lead to up to $10 in savings. While some jobs will be eliminated, of course, Smith said others will be created or reinvented. \"All knowledge workers will be affected in some way,\" he said. \"Some, there will no longer be that job category. For some, it will be a hyper accelerant of their capabilities. I tell people, AI is not going to replace the job in some businesses, but the person using AI will replace your job.\"",

In February, the company announced   a feature that lets consumers browse items from other brands' sites on Amazon. Some of those items include a button labeled   an artificial intelligence agent that can purchase products from other websites on a shopper's behalf. Amazon pitched the services, which are in testing phase for some U.S. users, as a way for shoppers to \"find any product they want and need,\" including items that aren't available on its site. Over the past decade, Amazon has increasingly turned to third-party merchants for products, and now says more than 60% of sales on its retail platform are from independent sellers.  In recent weeks, some businesses began to object to their products being sold on Amazon without their permission, according to     and  . Retailers, in some instances, said the program resulted in Amazon listing products that they never sold or that were out of stock. \"Sounds like a great program until the agentic AI starts selling customers things you don't have, all while your shop has no idea it's sending the wrong items to the customer,\" Hitchcock Paper, a Virginia-based stationery shop, said in   in late December.  The paper retailer said it discovered it was part of the program when it began receiving orders for a stress ball product, which it doesn't sell, from a \"buyforme.amazon\" email address.   CEO Angie Chua said she started receiving orders from Amazon's Buy for Me agent last week even though she hadn't opted in to the program. Her company sells stationery and journaling accessories through its   website as well as a storefront in Palm Springs, California. Chua told CNBC that, based on Amazon's instructions in  on its site, she reached out to the company to request that it pull her products. The listings were taken down within a few days, but she said the experience left her feeling \"exploited.\" \"We were forced to be dropshippers on a platform that we have made a conscious decision not to be part of,\" Chua said, referring to an online retail model that involves selling products to shoppers without storing the inventory. More than 180 businesses who sell their goods on Shopify, Squarespace, WooCommerce,   and other platforms have since contacted Chua to share that their products were also listed on Amazon without their permission, she said.  An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC that Shop Direct and Buy for Me help customers find products not sold on its site, \"while helping businesses reach new customers and drive incremental sales,\" and that the programs have \"received positive feedback.\"  \"Businesses can opt out at any time by emailing  , and we remove them from these programs promptly,\" the spokesperson said. The company said product and pricing information are pulled from public information on a brand's website and that Amazon's system checks to make sure the item is in stock and the price is right.  Amazon has said that Buy for Me remains an \"experiment\" and that it doesn't collect a commission when customers use it to make a purchase. In November, the company   the number of products available through Buy for Me had increased from 65,000 at launch to more 500,000. It's all part of Amazon's push into  , a technology that could potentially disrupt how people shop online. Companies including OpenAI,   and Perplexity have released features that allow consumers to purchase products from retailers and online marketplaces without leaving a chatbot window.  Amazon has blocked dozens of agents from accessing its site, while investing in its homegrown AI tools, and in November the company   Perplexity over an agent in the startup's Comet browser that allows it to make purchases on a user's behalf.  In the complaint, Amazon alleged Perplexity took steps to \"conceal\" its agents so they could continue to scrape Amazon's website without its approval. Perplexity called the lawsuit a \"bully tactic.\"  In 2024, Amazon released its own shopping chatbot called Rufus, which now has some agentic capabilities.",

                "full_text": "With fears growing of an investment bubble in artificial intelligence infrastructure, the next phase of AI growth will come from private software companies already creating massive gains in productivity, according to Robert Smith, CEO of Vista Equity Partners. The soaring valuations of  ,  ,  ,  , OpenAI and other hyperscalers and large-language models have dominated the debate over AI opportunities and risks. Yet some of the biggest investment opportunities in AI will be in non-public enterprise software companies that are using specific agents, or \"agentic AI,\"  to perform company tasks, according to Smith, who's also the founder and chairman of Vista. \"AI has sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the air for a lot of investors and pulled them into the Mag 7,\" Smith told CNBC. \"Those hyperscalers are now starting to build out the infrastructure and capability. Some may argue they're overvalued in some respects. But the [next] wave will be the application providers. And that's typically been the way that these cycles have played out. The application providers usually get the lion's share of the economic rent long term, once the technology has been diffused into those markets and diffused into those technologies. That's really where we are in the cycle.\" Vista's aggressive bet on applications and agentic software highlights one of the fastest-growing corners of the AI trade and alternative investments. Unlike the AI infrastructure sector — which includes dozens of publicly traded companies, hyperscalers and LLMs — the vast majority of companies creating AI applications are private. Smith said 97% of enterprise software companies are private. Vista aims to take the lead in the corporate agentic revolution. The private equity firm, with $100 billion in assets under management and over 90 portfolio companies specializing in enterprise software, has created an \"agentic factory\" to deploy AI across its companies and transform their businesses. Smith said 30 of Vista's companies are generating revenue from converting to agentic AI, and another 30 or 40 will convert in the coming months. \"Over two and a half years ago, we built out the infrastructure,\" Smith said. \"Now we have the right partners to do it with: the hyperscalers, who have capacity and technological capability that we can then infuse into each of our companies to make this a reality.\" The Inside Alts newsletter with Robert Frank and Leslie Picker is your guide to the fast-growing world of alternative investments. . One example is a Vista portfolio company called SimplePractice. The company's software helps mental-health professionals, using agents to record sessions, transcribe and draft notes. Another of Vista's companies, called Reslinc, helps companies assess their potential tariff exposure and meet regulatory requirements. Vista's approach challenges the theory that AI will \"eat software,\" as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang famously predicted in 2017. While it may weaken many software-as-a-service companies and allow companies to code and perform many software tasks themselves, agentic AI will accelerate the growth of enterprise software tools that can perform tasks with high levels of accuracy, Smith said. \"AI will enable enterprise software to eat services,\" he said. The gains in productivity and profits from agentic AI are already apparent. Vista's portfolio companies are seeing productivity gains of 30% to 50% in writing code, Smith said. Some tasks that take a person hours to do can be done in seconds with AI, he said. He said 20 cents' worth of \"inference,\" or running an AI model, can lead to up to $10 in savings. While some jobs will be eliminated, of course, Smith said others will be created or reinvented. \"All knowledge workers will be affected in some way,\" he said. \"Some, there will no longer be that job category. For some, it will be a hyper accelerant of their capabilities. I tell people, AI is not going to replace the job in some businesses, but the person using AI will replace your job.\"",

                "full_text": "With fears growing of an investment bubble in artificial intelligence infrastructure, the next phase of AI growth will come from private software companies already creating massive gains in productivity, according to Robert Smith, CEO of Vista Equity Partners. The soaring valuations of  ,  ,  ,  , OpenAI and other hyperscalers and large-language models have dominated the debate over AI opportunities and risks. Yet some of the biggest investment opportunities in AI will be in non-public enterprise software companies that are using specific agents, or \"agentic AI,\"  to perform company tasks, according to Smith, who's also the founder and chairman of Vista. \"AI has sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the air for a lot of investors and pulled them into the Mag 7,\" Smith told CNBC. \"Those hyperscalers are now starting to build out the infrastructure and capability. Some may argue they're overvalued in some respects. But the [next] wave will be the application providers. And that's typically been the way that these cycles have played out. The application providers usually get the lion's share of the economic rent long term, once the technology has been diffused into those markets and diffused into those technologies. That's really where we are in the cycle.\" Vista's aggressive bet on applications and agentic software highlights one of the fastest-growing corners of the AI trade and alternative investments. Unlike the AI infrastructure sector — which includes dozens of publicly traded companies, hyperscalers and LLMs — the vast majority of companies creating AI applications are private. Smith said 97% of enterprise software companies are private. Vista aims to take the lead in the corporate agentic revolution. The private equity firm, with $100 billion in assets under management and over 90 portfolio companies specializing in enterprise software, has created an \"agentic factory\" to deploy AI across its companies and transform their businesses. Smith said 30 of Vista's companies are generating revenue from converting to agentic AI, and another 30 or 40 will convert in the coming months. \"Over two and a half years ago, we built out the infrastructure,\" Smith said. \"Now we have the right partners to do it with: the hyperscalers, who have capacity and technological capability that we can then infuse into each of our companies to make this a reality.\" The Inside Alts newsletter with Robert Frank and Leslie Picker is your guide to the fast-growing world of alternative investments. . One example is a Vista portfolio company called SimplePractice. The company's software helps mental-health professionals, using agents to record sessions, transcribe and draft notes. Another of Vista's companies, called Reslinc, helps companies assess their potential tariff exposure and meet regulatory requirements. Vista's approach challenges the theory that AI will \"eat software,\" as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang famously predicted in 2017. While it may weaken many software-as-a-service companies and allow companies to code and perform many software tasks themselves, agentic AI will accelerate the growth of enterprise software tools that can perform tasks with high levels of accuracy, Smith said. \"AI will enable enterprise software to eat services,\" he said. The gains in productivity and profits from agentic AI are already apparent. Vista's portfolio companies are seeing productivity gains of 30% to 50% in writing code, Smith said. Some tasks that take a person hours to do can be done in seconds with AI, he said. He said 20 cents' worth of \"inference,\" or running an AI model, can lead to up to $10 in savings. While some jobs will be eliminated, of course, Smith said others will be created or reinvented. \"All knowledge workers will be affected in some way,\" he said. \"Some, there will no longer be that job category. For some, it will be a hyper accelerant of their capabilities. I tell people, AI is not going to replace the job in some businesses, but the person using AI will replace your job.\"",

                "full_text": "With fears growing of an investment bubble in artificial intelligence infrastructure, the next phase of AI growth will come from private software companies already creating massive gains in productivity, according to Robert Smith, CEO of Vista Equity Partners. The soaring valuations of  ,  ,  ,  , OpenAI and other hyperscalers and large-language models have dominated the debate over AI opportunities and risks. Yet some of the biggest investment opportunities in AI will be in non-public enterprise software companies that are using specific agents, or \"agentic AI,\"  to perform company tasks, according to Smith, who's also the founder and chairman of Vista. \"AI has sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the air for a lot of investors and pulled them into the Mag 7,\" Smith told CNBC. \"Those hyperscalers are now starting to build out the infrastructure and capability. Some may argue they're overvalued in some respects. But the [next] wave will be the application providers. And that's typically been the way that these cycles have played out. The application providers usually get the lion's share of the economic rent long term, once the technology has been diffused into those markets and diffused into those technologies. That's really where we are in the cycle.\" Vista's aggressive bet on applications and agentic software highlights one of the fastest-growing corners of the AI trade and alternative investments. Unlike the AI infrastructure sector — which includes dozens of publicly traded companies, hyperscalers and LLMs — the vast majority of companies creating AI applications are private. Smith said 97% of enterprise software companies are private. Vista aims to take the lead in the corporate agentic revolution. The private equity firm, with $100 billion in assets under management and over 90 portfolio companies specializing in enterprise software, has created an \"agentic factory\" to deploy AI across its companies and transform their businesses. Smith said 30 of Vista's companies are generating revenue from converting to agentic AI, and another 30 or 40 will convert in the coming months. \"Over two and a half years ago, we built out the infrastructure,\" Smith said. \"Now we have the right partners to do it with: the hyperscalers, who have capacity and technological capability that we can then infuse into each of our companies to make this a reality.\" The Inside Alts newsletter with Robert Frank and Leslie Picker is your guide to the fast-growing world of alternative investments. . One example is a Vista portfolio company called SimplePractice. The company's software helps mental-health professionals, using agents to record sessions, transcribe and draft notes. Another of Vista's companies, called Reslinc, helps companies assess their potential tariff exposure and meet regulatory requirements. Vista's approach challenges the theory that AI will \"eat software,\" as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang famously predicted in 2017. While it may weaken many software-as-a-service companies and allow companies to code and perform many software tasks themselves, agentic AI will accelerate the growth of enterprise software tools that can perform tasks with high levels of accuracy, Smith said. \"AI will enable enterprise software to eat services,\" he said. The gains in productivity and profits from agentic AI are already apparent. Vista's portfolio companies are seeing productivity gains of 30% to 50% in writing code, Smith said. Some tasks that take a person hours to do can be done in seconds with AI, he said. He said 20 cents' worth of \"inference,\" or running an AI model, can lead to up to $10 in savings. While some jobs will be eliminated, of course, Smith said others will be created or reinvented. \"All knowledge workers will be affected in some way,\" he said. \"Some, there will no longer be that job category. For some, it will be a hyper accelerant of their capabilities. I tell people, AI is not going to replace the job in some businesses, but the person using AI will replace your job.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article  has angered some online retailers that say they didn't consent to have their products scraped and listed on the e-commerce giant's sprawling marketplace. In February, the company announced   a feature that lets consumers browse items from other brands' sites on Amazon. Some of those items include a button labeled   an artificial intelligence agent that can purchase products from other websites on a shopper's behalf. Amazon pitched the services, which are in testing phase for some U.S. users, as a way for shoppers to \"find any product they want and need,\" including items that aren't available on its site. Over the past decade, Amazon has increasingly turned to third-party merchants for products, and now says more than 60% of sales on its retail platform are from independent sellers.  In recent weeks, some businesses began to object to their products being sold on Amazon without their permission, according to     and  . Retailers, in some instances, said the program resulted in Amazon listing products that they never sold or that were out of stock. \"Sounds like a great program until the agentic AI starts selling customers things you don't have, all while your shop has no idea it's sending the wrong items to the customer,\" Hitchcock Paper, a Virginia-based stationery shop, said in   in late December.  The paper retailer said it discovered it was part of the program when it began receiving orders for a stress ball product, which it doesn't sell, from a \"buyforme.amazon\" email address.   CEO Angie Chua said she started receiving orders from Amazon's Buy for Me agent last week even though she hadn't opted in to the program. Her company sells stationery and journaling accessories through its   website as well as a storefront in Palm Springs, California. Chua told CNBC that, based on Amazon's instructions in  on its site, she reached out to the company to request that it pull her products. The listings were taken down within a few days, but she said the experience left her feeling \"exploited.\" \"We were forced to be dropshippers on a platform that we have made a conscious decision not to be part of,\" Chua said, referring to an online retail model that involves selling products to shoppers without storing the inventory. More than 180 businesses who sell their goods on Shopify, Squarespace, WooCommerce,   and other platforms have since contacted Chua to share that their products were also listed on Amazon without their permission, she said.  An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC that Shop Direct and Buy for Me help customers find products not sold on its site, \"while helping businesses reach new customers and drive incremental sales,\" and that the programs have \"received positive feedback.\"  \"Businesses can opt out at any time by emailing  , and we remove them from these programs promptly,\" the spokesperson said. The company said product and pricing information are pulled from public information on a brand's website and that Amazon's system checks to make sure the item is in stock and the price is right.  Amazon has said that Buy for Me remains an \"experiment\" and that it doesn't collect a commission when customers use it to make a purchase. In November, the company   the number of products available through Buy for Me had increased from 65,000 at launch to more 500,000. It's all part of Amazon's push into  , a technology that could potentially disrupt how people shop online. Companies including OpenAI,   and Perplexity have released features that allow consumers to purchase products from retailers and online marketplaces without leaving a chatbot window.  Amazon has blocked dozens of agents from accessing its site, while investing in its homegrown AI tools, and in November the company   Perplexity over an agent in the startup's Comet browser that allows it to make purchases on a user's behalf.  In the complaint, Amazon alleged Perplexity took steps to \"conceal\" its agents so they could continue to scrape Amazon's website without its approval. Perplexity called the lawsuit a \"bully tactic.\"  In 2024, Amazon released its own shopping chatbot called Rufus, which now has some agentic capabilities.",

While it may weaken many software-as-a-service companies and allow companies to code and perform many software tasks themselves, agentic AI will accelerate the growth of enterprise software tools that can perform tasks with high levels of accuracy, Smith said. \"AI will enable enterprise software to eat services,\" he said. The gains in productivity and profits from agentic AI are already apparent. Vista's portfolio companies are seeing productivity gains of 30% to 50% in writing code, Smith said. Some tasks that take a person hours to do can be done in seconds with AI, he said. He said 20 cents' worth of \"inference,\" or running an AI model, can lead to up to $10 in savings. While some jobs will be eliminated, of course, Smith said others will be created or reinvented. \"All knowledge workers will be affected in some way,\" he said. \"Some, there will no longer be that job category. For some, it will be a hyper accelerant of their capabilities. I tell people, AI is not going to replace the job in some businesses, but the person using AI will replace your job.\"",

                "full_text": "SAN FRANCISCO —   has an energy that's hard to place — warm, unhurried, immediately present. She swept into a sunlit room on the ground floor of  's headquarters in December, sat down, and immediately apologized for her mug. \"Is my, like, gigantic novelty mug going to be distracting if I have it?\" she said. \"I'll defer to the wise camera people in terms of what's in the shot.\" It was a disarming kind of normal for someone operating at this level. Five years ago, she and her brother, Anthropic CEO  , led an exodus from  . They took a core group of senior researchers and started Anthropic with a contrarian bet: That safety and business success weren't in tension, that the real money wasn't in viral consumer products, and that the   race would be won by the company that knew when to slow down. \"We really just felt more like we were running towards something than running away from something,\" Daniela said of the decision to leave.  The co-founders had known each other for years before OpenAI. Her brother and co-founders Tom Brown and Chris Olah worked together at   Brain. Others overlapped at various labs.  Anthropic's headquarters is on \"AI Alley\" in San Francisco, a 230,000-square-foot glass high-rise in the shadow of   Tower. The neighborhood is a corridor of startups and tech giants reshaping the American economy from a handful of downtown blocks. Anthropic is now valued at $183 billion and on track to nearly double that, according to a newly signed term sheet, with   and   joining its cap table.  Revenue has grown ten times annually for three consecutive years, thanks in large part to the fact that the company's AI assistant, Claude, has become the model of choice for enterprises that care about reliability as much as capability. Daniela Amodei mentioned, almost in passing, that Claude once helped diagnose her with a bacterial infection after multiple doctors missed it. With her human-scale, here-and-now energy, she is by most counts the opposite of the AI founder archetype personified by OpenAI's   and  /xAI CEO  . Even her brother is a version of the technical visionary who speaks in timelines to superintelligence and treats interviews like TED talks. But Daniela Amodei is different. If her brother is the one looking for a path to the horizon, she is pouring the foundation that lets him get there. In November 2022, OpenAI fired the starting gun in the AI race. ChatGPT, a free chatbot anyone could talk to, went viral instantly, hitting 100 million users in two months.  Google scrambled.   went all in. The entire tech industry lurched into motion. But Anthropic didn't sprint.  From the start, Anthropic was defined by a contrarian posture toward OpenAI: move slower, ship later, and optimize for trust. While ChatGPT became a flashy consumer toy, the Amodeis made a different bet. They believed that the real money wasn't in viral moments, but in the less glamorous enterprise buildout behind them. It was in Fortune 500 contracts, developer tools, and APIs sold to companies where reliability, security, and compliance are mission critical. \"I wouldn't necessarily say that we knew for sure,\" Daniela Amodei told CNBC about the enterprise bet. \"Anthropic, as an organization, is well suited to be a B2B company. We really care about things like reliability and security and safety. That's baked into our DNA.\"  Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, said the AI frontier has shifted toward real work — coding, math, science — the kinds of tasks companies will actually pay for.  \"The frontier isn't about making our chat better,\" he said, pointing to Anthropic's strength with developers, where Claude has built a reputation as a top-tier programming model, outpacing key rivals in many users' workflows. Even back in 2020, Daniela Amodei said the team could see a future where Claude would handle many of the high-intelligence tasks humans do at work. \"And we thought, that's a pretty big market.\"  its business customer base has grown from under 1,000 to more than 300,000 in two years, and nearly 80% of Claude activity now comes from outside the United States.  The   reads like a who's who of global enterprise, with  , the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund — the world's largest — plus Bridgewater, Stripe, and Slack, all running Claude at scale. Sameer Dholakia, a partner at Bessemer Ventures who invested in Anthropic, said the bet made sense for one simple reason: enterprise customers don't churn the way consumers do. \"We really love the focus that they had, and candidly, the focus of Anthropic on safety and trust, we knew was going to play really well with the enterprise buyer, and that's proven to be true.\" While OpenAI still leads in scale and cultural cachet, with ChatGPT a household name boasting nearly 900 million weekly active users, Anthropic is closing the gap fast — and in some areas is already ahead. Today, Anthropic's revenue is roughly 85% business. OpenAI is more than 60% consumer. \"One of the values and the things that we talk about a lot internally is just how not to believe the hype,\" Daniela Amodei told CNBC. \"For us, it's never been about seeking attention or sort of being in the headlines. We're really here to do the work.\" \"As Anthropic goes, so goes generative AI,\" said Alex Kantrowitz, founder of the independent publication Big Technology. \"They have the most pure bet on this technology working. If Anthropic is able to make it work, all of GenAI is going to work. And if not, we're going to have some serious problems.\" Anthropic's lead in enterprise is proving durable. And it's a lead the Amodei siblings have built together. \"It's genuinely a privilege to run Anthropic with my sibling,\" Daniela Amodei said. \"We've known each other our whole lives — or my whole life, at least. He had four years without me, poor guy.\" \"Dario and I really help each other,\" she added. \"He's great at pushing me to think about the big picture... I am helpful in thinking about, like, how do we build an organization that is enduring, that's sustainable, that's filled with great people who really want to do the type of work that we set out to do five years ago.\" There's always more work to do, Amodei said, and the models are getting exponentially smarter. She framed it as a lesson from the last generation of tech: If social media companies could go back in time, knowing what their platforms would unleash, would they have done anything differently?  Anthropic, she said, is trying to answer that question now: \"To talk about the risks and try to mitigate them\" while it still can. Daniela Amodei is betting it can. She's built her whole company around that conviction.  to learn more.",

                "full_text": "President   in a social media post Thursday evening indirectly revealed data from Friday's market-moving nonfarm payrolls count, an apparent violation of long-standing federal policy on statistical releases. In a   around 9 p.m. ET, the president indicated that private sector payrolls had expanded by 654,000 for the full year of 2025, a total that would have included Friday's jobs count for December.  Office of Management and Budget policy   from commenting on such releases early and in fact forbids public statements until 30 minutes after the release.  Presidents can be briefed on official jobs figures ahead of the release. A White House official conceded, however, that \"there was an inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data that was partially derived from pre-released information. The White House is accordingly reviewing protocols regarding economic data releases.\" The official further chided the media for \"grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy\" and instead urged a focus on how \"President Trump's policies are laying the groundwork for an economic resurgence as GDP and real wage growth continue to accelerate.\" The Trump post drew a distinction between private and government job growth, with the latter down 181,000 for 2025. Friday's jobs data release went on to show that   increased 50,000 for December, all but 2,000 of which came from the private sector. The figures, while slightly less than official economists' estimates, assuaged concerns about a steeper drop in employment. Stock futures trended higher following the data. While Trump's post would not allow traders to calculate the exact payrolls figure because of lack of data on revisions, they could have gleaned a rough estimation of the figure and possibly ruled out a December job-loss scenario that would have spooked markets. Trump once   somewhat a positive jobs figure in his first term, drawing criticism.",

                "full_text": "against OpenAI will proceed to trial, further escalating his yearslong feud with the company and its CEO, Sam Altman.  \"We appreciate the Court's thorough and fair consideration and look forward to trial,\" Musk's lead counsel, Marc Toberoff, told CNBC's David Faber Thursday in a statement following a hearing with U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. Musk and Altman co-founded OpenAI as a nonprofit research company alongside several other researchers and executives in 2015. Musk   from OpenAI's board in 2018 after trying to convince Altman to let his autos business,  , acquire the AI nonprofit. In the lawsuit, Musk alleged he agreed to start the company because he was promised that it would \"chart a safer, more open course than profit-driven tech giants,\" according to  . \"The hearing confirms what we've maintained from the outset — there is substantial evidence that OpenAI's leadership made knowingly false assurances to Mr. Musk about its charitable mission that they never honored in favor of their personal self-enrichment,\" Toberoff said. OpenAI has repeatedly denied the claims, and lawyers for the company have filed a motion to dismiss the case. The Tesla CEO alleges in the suit that he was \"assiduously manipulated\" and \"deceived\" after OpenAI established an \"opaque web of for-profit OpenAI affiliates,\" including its multibillion-dollar partnership with  , and explored converting to a for-profit entity, the filing states.  He claimed Altman and the other defendants have been \"unjustly enriched to the tune of billions of dollars in value.\" A spokesperson for OpenAI said Thursday that Musk's lawsuit \"continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment.\" \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever,\" the spokesperson said.  Gonzalez Rogers said Wednesday that the case would head to trial, according to the  . The judge said she still needed to determine some of the logistics as to how that trial will be set up. Microsoft is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, as Musk alleges the company aided and abetted OpenAI's breach of fiduciary duty. A representative for Microsoft did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. The lawsuit was filed in August 2024 in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California.  In 2024, OpenAI announced plans to convert into a  , which would have wrested control from the nonprofit and kept it as a separate arm. After facing pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees, OpenAI said its nonprofit would retain control. The startup announced   in October, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business.  As part of that recapitalization, Microsoft holds an investment in OpenAI's for-profit arm valued at around $135 billion.  Musk has long warned about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence and the risks it could pose for humanity, and launched his own   company called xAI in 2023. He competes directly with OpenAI,  , Anthropic and other AI players.  XAI started as a for-profit, \"benefit corporation\" with an obligation to deliver environmental and social benefits through its work. The company dropped that obligation and its benefit corporation status in 2025 when Musk merged xAI with his social network X. Musk has come under fire in recent weeks after the company's chatbot and image generator, Grok, allowed users to easily create and share what's known as \"deepfake porn,\" or nonconsensual intimate images of real-life women, and AI-generated images depicting child sexual abuse.  X and xAI are facing regulatory probes over the images by the European Commission, India, Malaysia and Australia.",

                "full_text": "In this article  plans to introduce eyes-off driving technology on an upcoming $30,000 all-electric vehicle in 2028, the Detroit automaker announced Wednesday. The target brings Ford into a race against competitors such as  ,   and   to develop and broadly launch such systems, which Wall Street views as a potential growth market to fully autonomous vehicles.  Ford's plan is similar to those of other automakers, but the company notably plans to offer the new system on a mainstream EV first, rather than on a pricier model — defying typical technology rollouts in the automotive industry. \"It's part of what has evolved to be a broader technology strategy of putting our best and newest technology where the volume is and where the accessibility is,\" Doug Field, Ford's chief EV, digital and design officer, told CNBC during an interview. The first vehicle to feature the new system is expected to be built on the company's upcoming \"Universal EV platform,\" which   is capable of supporting a variety of vehicles. The first is a roughly $30,000 midsize pickup truck set to hit the market in 2027.  Field, who joined Ford after stints with   and Tesla, said the first vehicle with the eyes-off system will come at that starting price, but did not disclose if it would be the pickup truck. Ford has said the next-generation EV platform reduces parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations in the plant and 15% faster assembly time. Field announced the eyes-off system at the CES technology show in Las Vegas alongside other plans, including a new vehicle software architecture as well as a Ford-engineered artificial intelligence assistant.   announced similar plans, including an AI assistant and an eyes-off system expected to launch in 2028 on its electric Cadillac Escalade IQ. That vehicle currently starts at more than $127,000. Ford, led by CEO  , is under pressure to deliver on the new vehicle platform, known as UEV, and its supporting technologies, which largely fall under Field. The company has wasted billions of dollars amid shifting EV strategies as well as quality and production issues in recent years. Ford has significantly cut back its spending on EVs and has moved focus from large all-electric pickup trucks and SUVs to smaller, more affordable models through a special project, or \"skunkworks,\" team that created the UEV platform. Ford announced plans to   in U.S. plants to produce the vehicles and the batteries to power them. Field referred to the skunkworks team as a \"bet\" over the last couple of years that has \"started to build a tremendous amount of confidence\" over the \"last few months.\"  He said Ford now has all of the critical software and supporting hardware it needs in-house for a new generation of technologically advanced vehicles to differentiate the automaker. \"One of the things we're seeing is just how much faster our development process works on this product and this architecture compared to what we've done in the past,\" Field said. \"So, we have a lot of confidence in our ability to get this out.\" Ford last month said it expects   in special items through 2027 related to such restructuring efforts and its pullback in EV investments. Field said Ford's planned eyes-off system, which the auto industry refers to as \"Level 3 driving automation,\" will utilize an array of sensors and in-house software development to lower costs compared to competitors.  Field declined to comment on the roadmap for expanding the new system to other vehicles, but said the goal is to commoditize the technology.  \"The actual rollout schedule will be based on a lot of work we have to do on which customers need it in their applications, when, and which products are most ready for it now,\" Field said. \"It'll take time to roll it out everywhere, but we'll prioritize that based on where we will have the biggest impact on customers.\" SAE International, formerly known as the Society of Automotive Engineers, has   for vehicles from Level 0 to Level 5. The highest, Level 5, is a fully autonomous vehicle, with each stage from Level 0 adding more technologies and enabling human drivers to be more \"out of the loop.\" Ford currently offers a Level 2 advanced driver assistance system, or ADAS, known as BlueCruise. While active, a vehicle can drive itself under certain circumstances without human intervention on divided highways, but drivers still need to pay attention to the roads and system in case of problems.   Ford's new AI assistant is expected to launch in early 2026 through its phone apps for Ford and Lincoln, followed by a native in-vehicle experience starting in 2027, the company said Wednesday.  Several other automakers also have announced plans for AI digital assistants, but Field said he believes Ford's will offer unique capabilities specific to each car or truck by utilizing each vehicle's unique identification number. Ford said the AI assistant will be able to review a picture of a trailer to confirm whether a vehicle can properly tow it, for example, or assess how many bags of mulch the interior of a car or truck can hold.  \"The AI companion is something we think we can make special for Ford, representative of what we're trying to do on the customer experience side,\" Field said. Assisting in that better customer experience is expected to be an updated in-house software architecture that Ford's calling an \"integrated digital platform\" that will debut with the UEV platform. The company said the updated system will result in \"a more unified 'brain inside' the vehicle — a single, powerful module that unifies infotainment, ADAS, audio, and networking.\" \"For customers, that means a vehicle that feels more consistent, more reliable, and more capable year after year,\" Field said in a blog post accompanying the CES announcements.",

CNBC compiled responses from 40 tech executives, analysts and other professionals in the space, who shared their thoughts over the past four months about the current AI frenzy. Although the question of whether or not the market is in a bubble seems binary, many answers have landed across a spectrum of bubble potential — and worry. To give each response a more rounded perspective, CNBC also weighed the level of concern. CNBC scored each person's remarks on a scale from 0 to 10 on two factors: How much they believe that AI is in a bubble (0 being no and 10 being yes) and how concerned they are about it (0 being not concerned at all and 10 being very concerned).",

                "full_text": "SAN FRANCISCO —   has an energy that's hard to place — warm, unhurried, immediately present. She swept into a sunlit room on the ground floor of  's headquarters in December, sat down, and immediately apologized for her mug. \"Is my, like, gigantic novelty mug going to be distracting if I have it?\" she said. \"I'll defer to the wise camera people in terms of what's in the shot.\" It was a disarming kind of normal for someone operating at this level. Five years ago, she and her brother, Anthropic CEO  , led an exodus from  . They took a core group of senior researchers and started Anthropic with a contrarian bet: That safety and business success weren't in tension, that the real money wasn't in viral consumer products, and that the   race would be won by the company that knew when to slow down. \"We really just felt more like we were running towards something than running away from something,\" Daniela said of the decision to leave.  The co-founders had known each other for years before OpenAI. Her brother and co-founders Tom Brown and Chris Olah worked together at   Brain. Others overlapped at various labs.  Anthropic's headquarters is on \"AI Alley\" in San Francisco, a 230,000-square-foot glass high-rise in the shadow of   Tower. The neighborhood is a corridor of startups and tech giants reshaping the American economy from a handful of downtown blocks. Anthropic is now valued at $183 billion and on track to nearly double that, according to a newly signed term sheet, with   and   joining its cap table.  Revenue has grown ten times annually for three consecutive years, thanks in large part to the fact that the company's AI assistant, Claude, has become the model of choice for enterprises that care about reliability as much as capability. Daniela Amodei mentioned, almost in passing, that Claude once helped diagnose her with a bacterial infection after multiple doctors missed it. With her human-scale, here-and-now energy, she is by most counts the opposite of the AI founder archetype personified by OpenAI's   and  /xAI CEO  . Even her brother is a version of the technical visionary who speaks in timelines to superintelligence and treats interviews like TED talks. But Daniela Amodei is different. If her brother is the one looking for a path to the horizon, she is pouring the foundation that lets him get there. In November 2022, OpenAI fired the starting gun in the AI race. ChatGPT, a free chatbot anyone could talk to, went viral instantly, hitting 100 million users in two months.  Google scrambled.   went all in. The entire tech industry lurched into motion. But Anthropic didn't sprint.  From the start, Anthropic was defined by a contrarian posture toward OpenAI: move slower, ship later, and optimize for trust. While ChatGPT became a flashy consumer toy, the Amodeis made a different bet. They believed that the real money wasn't in viral moments, but in the less glamorous enterprise buildout behind them. It was in Fortune 500 contracts, developer tools, and APIs sold to companies where reliability, security, and compliance are mission critical. \"I wouldn't necessarily say that we knew for sure,\" Daniela Amodei told CNBC about the enterprise bet. \"Anthropic, as an organization, is well suited to be a B2B company. We really care about things like reliability and security and safety. That's baked into our DNA.\"  Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, said the AI frontier has shifted toward real work — coding, math, science — the kinds of tasks companies will actually pay for.  \"The frontier isn't about making our chat better,\" he said, pointing to Anthropic's strength with developers, where Claude has built a reputation as a top-tier programming model, outpacing key rivals in many users' workflows. Even back in 2020, Daniela Amodei said the team could see a future where Claude would handle many of the high-intelligence tasks humans do at work. \"And we thought, that's a pretty big market.\"  its business customer base has grown from under 1,000 to more than 300,000 in two years, and nearly 80% of Claude activity now comes from outside the United States.  The   reads like a who's who of global enterprise, with  , the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund — the world's largest — plus Bridgewater, Stripe, and Slack, all running Claude at scale. Sameer Dholakia, a partner at Bessemer Ventures who invested in Anthropic, said the bet made sense for one simple reason: enterprise customers don't churn the way consumers do. \"We really love the focus that they had, and candidly, the focus of Anthropic on safety and trust, we knew was going to play really well with the enterprise buyer, and that's proven to be true.\" While OpenAI still leads in scale and cultural cachet, with ChatGPT a household name boasting nearly 900 million weekly active users, Anthropic is closing the gap fast — and in some areas is already ahead. Today, Anthropic's revenue is roughly 85% business. OpenAI is more than 60% consumer. \"One of the values and the things that we talk about a lot internally is just how not to believe the hype,\" Daniela Amodei told CNBC. \"For us, it's never been about seeking attention or sort of being in the headlines. We're really here to do the work.\" \"As Anthropic goes, so goes generative AI,\" said Alex Kantrowitz, founder of the independent publication Big Technology. \"They have the most pure bet on this technology working. If Anthropic is able to make it work, all of GenAI is going to work. And if not, we're going to have some serious problems.\" Anthropic's lead in enterprise is proving durable. And it's a lead the Amodei siblings have built together. \"It's genuinely a privilege to run Anthropic with my sibling,\" Daniela Amodei said. \"We've known each other our whole lives — or my whole life, at least. He had four years without me, poor guy.\" \"Dario and I really help each other,\" she added. \"He's great at pushing me to think about the big picture... I am helpful in thinking about, like, how do we build an organization that is enduring, that's sustainable, that's filled with great people who really want to do the type of work that we set out to do five years ago.\" There's always more work to do, Amodei said, and the models are getting exponentially smarter. She framed it as a lesson from the last generation of tech: If social media companies could go back in time, knowing what their platforms would unleash, would they have done anything differently?  Anthropic, she said, is trying to answer that question now: \"To talk about the risks and try to mitigate them\" while it still can. Daniela Amodei is betting it can. She's built her whole company around that conviction.  to learn more.",

                "full_text": "China said Thursday it will investigate  's $2 billion acquisition of artificial intelligence startup Manus to assess its compliance with export control laws. Meta   Singapore-based Manus last month as the U.S. tech giant looks to integrate advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products.  Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but the Wall Street Journal   that the deal closed at an amount over $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the acquisition. China's Ministry of Commerce said it will conduct an assessment and investigation into how the acquisition complies with laws and regulations concerning export controls, technology import and export, and overseas investment, according to a statement translated by Google. \"The Chinese government consistently supports enterprises in conducting mutually beneficial transnational operations and international technological cooperation in accordance with laws and regulations,\" Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong said at a press briefing. CNBC has contacted Meta and Manus for comment. Manus began as a product of Chinese start-up Butterfly Effect, also known as Monica.Im, before growing into a separate entity, which relocated to Singapore earlier this year.  The startup was hailed as the next DeepSeek after it launched its first AI agent in March, which can help with tasks such as market research, coding and data analysis.  The company   laid off most of its staff in Beijing in July as it eyed global expansion. Manus said the Meta acquisition would see the company continue to operate from Singapore. The startup said it had 105 employees across the South Asian nation, Tokyo, and San Francisco in December. Manus said it had passed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in December, eight months on from launching a product, which it claimed made it the fastest startup in the world to hit the milestone from $0. \"Manus's exceptional talent will join Meta's team to deliver general-purpose agents across our consumer and business products, including in Meta AI,\" Meta said in a statement in December.  The acquisition follows the company raising $75 million in a round led by U.S. VC Benchmark in April.  China's probe \"underlines that [the country] considers advanced AI agents, models and related IP to be strategic assets,\" Nick Patience, AI lead at The Futurum Group, told CNBC. \"The most likely outcome I see is a lengthier approval process and potential conditions around how Manus technology developed in China can be used, rather than an outright block, but the threat of stricter action gives Beijing bargaining power in a high profile, US led acquisition,\" he added. Meta's Manus acquisition comes as the company has spent billions of dollars building out AI capabilities in the face of advances from rivals OpenAI and  .  In June, the company invested   in a 49% stake in AI startup Scale AI, which brought founder and CEO Alexandr Wang onto the tech giant's leadership team. Meta also   it was acquiring AI wearable startup Limitless in December. Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg has been deprioritizing the company's Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) unit in favor of its more product-oriented GenAI team to help Meta make headway in AI and improve its Llama family of AI models, CNBC previously  .",

                "full_text": "In this article  has identified itself as the mystery company behind a prospective data center in a part of Michigan where locals have objected to such a development.  On Wednesday, Microsoft's cloud infrastructure team was named in a  , published by Lowell Charter Township, as the party eyeing a 237-acre lot beside Interstate 96. The township, with a population of around 6,500, is located 20 miles southeast of Grand Rapids. The letter came after weeks of speculation about who was collaborating with developer Franklin Partners for the controversial project. Franklin, based in Illinois, had previously said it was working with a national company based in the U.S. to build a data center on the land.  In December, locals crowded into a planning commission meeting, where a public hearing on the proposed rezoning was on the agenda, leading to the postponement of the event. News outlet   reported that a Grand Rapids business owner appeared in a Mr. Peanut costume and held up a sign saying \"This is nuts.\"  Some in the area have said the township was moving too quickly to rezone the land, given the absence of clarity surrounding issues like energy requirements to operate the facility. Days after the canceled meeting, local officials said they were temporarily holding off on moving forward with the project. \"We are introducing ourselves now because we have observed that the community would like more information about the proposal, and we believe it is important to be transparent about our intentions moving forward,\" Microsoft said in Wednesday's letter. \"We asked the seller to pause the rezone process so that we could spend time with the community early this year and share more about our potential long-term plans before we proceed.\" Microsoft is set to nearly double the size of its data center portfolio in the next two years, CEO   told analysts in October. It's among a group of industry heavyweights, including  ,  ,  ,  , OpenAI and   xAI, rushing to spin up data centers packed with   graphics processing units and other infrastructure needed to run powerful artificial intelligence models and workloads.  Tech's megacaps are collectively committing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to capital expenditures, raising concerns that they're fueling another industry bubble.  Utilities in some U.S. markets have said they won't be able to supply the energy needed for these planned data centers, which has made site selection more difficult. Residents living near the sites of proposed facilities have been  , citing a range of concerns. Water   is one of the key issues. The Michigan township said it has an agreement with the nearby city of Lowell to provide a path for increased \"capacity of the plant at no additional cost to rate payers.\" Consumers Energy, a utility serving millions of Michiganders,   data centers will not lead to higher electricity rates. The lot in the Covenant Business Park in the township is zoned as industrial planned unit development, and has sat empty, in part because of a lack of water and sewer services. The township's board would have to approve to change the zoning to light industrial for the project to advance. The development would result in $500 million to $1 billion in investment over the course of three to five years, the township said. The planning commission is set to meet again on Jan. 12.",

                "full_text": "In this article All computing devices require a part called memory, or RAM, for short-term data storage, but this year, there won't be enough of these essential components to meet worldwide demand. That's because companies like  ,   and   need so much RAM for their artificial intelligence chips, and those companies are the first ones in line for the components.  Three primary memory vendors —  , SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics — make up nearly the entire RAM market, and their businesses are benefitting from the surge in demand.  We have seen a very sharp, significant surge in demand for memory, and it has far outpaced our ability to supply that memory and, in our estimation, the supply capability of the whole memory industry,\" Micron business chief Sumit Sadana told CNBC this week at the CES trade show in Las Vegas.  Micron's stock is up 247% over the past year, and the company reported that net income   in the most recent quarter.   that it expects its December quarter operating profit to nearly triple as well. Meanwhile,   as its stock price in South Korea surges, and in October, the company said it had secured demand  .  Now, prices for memory are rising.  TrendForce, a Taipei-based researcher that closely covers the memory market, this week said it expects average DRAM memory prices to rise between 50% and 55% this quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2025. TrendForce analyst Tom Hsu told CNBC that type of increase for memory prices was \"unprecedented.\"  Chipmakers like Nvidia surround the part of the chip that does the computation — the graphics processing unit, or GPU — with several blocks of a fast, specialized component called high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, Sadana said. HBM is often visible when chipmakers hold up their new chips. Micron supplies memory to both Nvidia and AMD, the two leading GPU makers.  Nvidia's Rubin GPU, which recently entered production, comes with up to 288 gigabytes of next-generation HBM4 memory per chip. HBM is installed in eight visible blocks above and below the processor, and that GPU will be sold as part of single server rack called NVL72, which fittingly combines 72 of those GPUs into a single system. By comparison, smartphones typically come with 8 or 12GB of lower-powered DDR memory. But the HBM memory that AI chips need is much more demanding than the RAM used for consumers' laptops and smartphones. HBM is designed for high-bandwidth specifications required by AI chips, and it's produced in a complicated process where Micron stacks 12 to 16 layers of memory on a single chip, turning it into a \"cube.\" When Micron makes one bit of HBM memory, it has to forgo making three bits of more conventional memory for other devices. \"As we increase HBM supply, it leaves less memory left over for the non-HBM portion of the market, because of this three-to-one basis,\" Sadana said.  Hsu, the TrendForce analyst, said that memory makers are favoring server and HBM applications over other clients because there's higher potential for growth in demand in that business and cloud service providers are less price-sensitive.  In December, Micron said it would   a part of its business that aimed to provide memory for consumer PC builders so the company could save supply for AI chips and servers.  Some inside the tech industry are marveling at how much and how quickly the price of RAM for consumers has increased.  Dean Beeler, co-founder and tech chief at Juice Labs, said that a few months ago, he loaded up his computer with 256GB of RAM, the maximum amount that current consumer motherboards support. That cost him about $300 at the time.  \"Who knew that would end up being ~$3,000 of RAM just a few months later,\" he posted on Facebook on Monday. AI researchers started to see memory as a bottleneck just before   ChatGPT hit the market in late 2022, said Majestic Labs co-founder Sha Rabii, an entrepreneur who previously worked on silicon at Google and  . Prior AI systems were designed for models like convolutional neural networks, which require less memory than large language models, or LLMs, that are popular today, Rabii said.   While AI chips themselves have been getting much faster, memory has not, he said, which leads to powerful GPUs waiting around to get the data needed to run LLMs.  \"Your performance is limited by the amount of memory and the speed of the memory that you have, and if you keep adding more GPUs, it's not a win,\" Rabii said.  The AI industry refers to this as the \"memory wall.\"  \"The processor spends more time just twiddling its thumbs, waiting for data,\" Micron's Sadana said. More and faster memory means that AI systems can run bigger models, serve more customers simultaneously and add \"context windows\" that allow chatbots and other LLMs to remember previous conversations with users, which adds a touch of personalization to the experience.  Majestic Labs is   an AI system for inference with 128 terabytes of memory, or about 100 times more memory than some current AI systems, Rabii said, adding that the company plans to eschew HBM memory for lower-cost options. Rabii said the additional RAM and architecture support in the design will enable its computers to support significantly more users at the same time than other AI servers while using less power. Wall Street has been asking companies in the consumer electronics business, like   and  , how they will handle the memory shortage and if they might be forced to raise prices or cut margins. These days, memory accounts for about 20% of the hardware costs of a laptop, Hsu said. That's up from between 10% and 18% in the first half of 2025.  In October, Apple finance chief Kevan Parekh told analysts that his company was seeing a \"slight tailwind\" on memory prices but he downplayed it as \"nothing really to note there.\" But in November, Dell said it expected its cost basis for all of its products to go up as a result of the memory shortage. COO Jefferey Clarke told analysts that Dell planned to change its mix of configurations to minimize the price impacts, but he said the shortage will likely affect retail prices for devices.  \"I don't see how this will not make its way into the customer base,\" Clarke said. \"We'll do everything we can to mitigate that.\" Even Nvidia, which has emerged as the biggest customer in the HBM market, is facing questions about its ravenous memory needs — in particular, about its consumer products. At a press conference Tuesday at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was asked if he was concerned that the company's gaming customers might be resentful of AI technology because of rising game console and graphics cards prices that are being driven by the memory shortage.  Huang said Nvidia is a very large customer of memory and has long relationships with the companies in the space but that, ultimately, there would need to be more memory factories because the needs of AI are so high. \"Because our demand is so high, every factory, every HBM supplier, is gearing up, and they're all doing great,\" Huang said.  At most, Micron can only meet two-thirds of the medium-term memory requirements for some customers, Sadana said. But the company is currently building two big factories called fabs in Boise, Idaho, that will start producing memory in 2027 and 2028, he said. Micron is also going to break ground on a fab in the town of Clay, New York, that he said is expect to come online in 2030. But for now, \"we're sold out for 2026,\" Sadana said.",

                "full_text": "In this article  on Friday announced agreements with three nuclear power providers, including one backed by OpenAI CEO  , as part of its efforts to secure necessary resources for its AI ambitions.  The arrangements with  , TerraPower and  , which are all working on nuclear power technologies, are for Meta's   supercluster computing system that's being built at a data center in New Albany, Ohio. No financial terms were disclosed.  Shares of Vistra and Oklo climbed following the news, rising 10% and 8%, respectively. Meta shares closed 1% higher. Meta CEO   announced Prometheus in July, describing the system as one of the keys to the development of the company's advanced artificial intelligence efforts. Meta has said it expects Prometheus to come online sometime in 2026.  In working with the three companies on energy production, Meta said the projects should add 6.6 gigawatts of power by 2035, exceeding the total demand of New Hampshire. \"State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America's position as a global leader in AI,\" Meta policy chief Joel Kaplan said in a statement.  The company said it will help fund Vistra's nuclear power plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania, extending the lifespan of those facilities and increasing their energy production. The other two companies' nuclear projects are still being developed.  Meta expects the agreements to create \"thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of long-term operational jobs.\" The deals mark the latest efforts by Meta to secure the energy needed to power its AI infrastructure as the company marches toward Zuckerberg's goal of developing superintelligence, a term used to describe AI that can greatly exceed the capabilities of humans on numerous tasks. Meta's megacap rivals are also looking to nuclear power to help fuel their AI work. Meta,   and   signed a pledge in March   the tripling of global nuclear energy production by 2050. In June, Meta announced a 20-year agreement with   so it could purchase purchase nuclear power from the company's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois beginning in 2027. Meta's deal with TerraPower will provide funding for two of the energy company's nuclear projects that are under development and could begin generating power by 2032, according to Friday's announcement. Meta said it could obtain rights for more energy from up to six of TerraPower's other nuclear energy projects that are targeted for delivery by 2035.  Meanwhile, Oklo's advanced nuclear technology campus is expected to come online as soon as 2030 in Pike County, Ohio, Meta said.  OpenAI's Altman is one of Oklo's biggest investors, owning a 4.3% stake worth about $650 million as of Thursday's close, according to FactSet.

                "full_text": "SAN FRANCISCO —   has an energy that's hard to place — warm, unhurried, immediately present. She swept into a sunlit room on the ground floor of  's headquarters in December, sat down, and immediately apologized for her mug. \"Is my, like, gigantic novelty mug going to be distracting if I have it?\" she said. \"I'll defer to the wise camera people in terms of what's in the shot.\" It was a disarming kind of normal for someone operating at this level. Five years ago, she and her brother, Anthropic CEO  , led an exodus from  . They took a core group of senior researchers and started Anthropic with a contrarian bet: That safety and business success weren't in tension, that the real money wasn't in viral consumer products, and that the   race would be won by the company that knew when to slow down. \"We really just felt more like we were running towards something than running away from something,\" Daniela said of the decision to leave.  The co-founders had known each other for years before OpenAI. Her brother and co-founders Tom Brown and Chris Olah worked together at   Brain. Others overlapped at various labs.  Anthropic's headquarters is on \"AI Alley\" in San Francisco, a 230,000-square-foot glass high-rise in the shadow of   Tower. The neighborhood is a corridor of startups and tech giants reshaping the American economy from a handful of downtown blocks. Anthropic is now valued at $183 billion and on track to nearly double that, according to a newly signed term sheet, with   and   joining its cap table.  Revenue has grown ten times annually for three consecutive years, thanks in large part to the fact that the company's AI assistant, Claude, has become the model of choice for enterprises that care about reliability as much as capability. Daniela Amodei mentioned, almost in passing, that Claude once helped diagnose her with a bacterial infection after multiple doctors missed it. With her human-scale, here-and-now energy, she is by most counts the opposite of the AI founder archetype personified by OpenAI's   and  /xAI CEO  . Even her brother is a version of the technical visionary who speaks in timelines to superintelligence and treats interviews like TED talks. But Daniela Amodei is different. If her brother is the one looking for a path to the horizon, she is pouring the foundation that lets him get there. In November 2022, OpenAI fired the starting gun in the AI race. ChatGPT, a free chatbot anyone could talk to, went viral instantly, hitting 100 million users in two months.  Google scrambled.   went all in. The entire tech industry lurched into motion. But Anthropic didn't sprint.  From the start, Anthropic was defined by a contrarian posture toward OpenAI: move slower, ship later, and optimize for trust. While ChatGPT became a flashy consumer toy, the Amodeis made a different bet. They believed that the real money wasn't in viral moments, but in the less glamorous enterprise buildout behind them. It was in Fortune 500 contracts, developer tools, and APIs sold to companies where reliability, security, and compliance are mission critical. \"I wouldn't necessarily say that we knew for sure,\" Daniela Amodei told CNBC about the enterprise bet. \"Anthropic, as an organization, is well suited to be a B2B company. We really care about things like reliability and security and safety. That's baked into our DNA.\"  Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, said the AI frontier has shifted toward real work — coding, math, science — the kinds of tasks companies will actually pay for.  \"The frontier isn't about making our chat better,\" he said, pointing to Anthropic's strength with developers, where Claude has built a reputation as a top-tier programming model, outpacing key rivals in many users' workflows. Even back in 2020, Daniela Amodei said the team could see a future where Claude would handle many of the high-intelligence tasks humans do at work. \"And we thought, that's a pretty big market.\"  its business customer base has grown from under 1,000 to more than 300,000 in two years, and nearly 80% of Claude activity now comes from outside the United States.  The   reads like a who's who of global enterprise, with  , the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund — the world's largest — plus Bridgewater, Stripe, and Slack, all running Claude at scale. Sameer Dholakia, a partner at Bessemer Ventures who invested in Anthropic, said the bet made sense for one simple reason: enterprise customers don't churn the way consumers do. \"We really love the focus that they had, and candidly, the focus of Anthropic on safety and trust, we knew was going to play really well with the enterprise buyer, and that's proven to be true.\" While OpenAI still leads in scale and cultural cachet, with ChatGPT a household name boasting nearly 900 million weekly active users, Anthropic is closing the gap fast — and in some areas is already ahead. Today, Anthropic's revenue is roughly 85% business. OpenAI is more than 60% consumer. \"One of the values and the things that we talk about a lot internally is just how not to believe the hype,\" Daniela Amodei told CNBC. \"For us, it's never been about seeking attention or sort of being in the headlines. We're really here to do the work.\" \"As Anthropic goes, so goes generative AI,\" said Alex Kantrowitz, founder of the independent publication Big Technology. \"They have the most pure bet on this technology working. If Anthropic is able to make it work, all of GenAI is going to work. And if not, we're going to have some serious problems.\" Anthropic's lead in enterprise is proving durable. And it's a lead the Amodei siblings have built together. \"It's genuinely a privilege to run Anthropic with my sibling,\" Daniela Amodei said. \"We've known each other our whole lives — or my whole life, at least. He had four years without me, poor guy.\" \"Dario and I really help each other,\" she added. \"He's great at pushing me to think about the big picture... I am helpful in thinking about, like, how do we build an organization that is enduring, that's sustainable, that's filled with great people who really want to do the type of work that we set out to do five years ago.\" There's always more work to do, Amodei said, and the models are getting exponentially smarter. She framed it as a lesson from the last generation of tech: If social media companies could go back in time, knowing what their platforms would unleash, would they have done anything differently?  Anthropic, she said, is trying to answer that question now: \"To talk about the risks and try to mitigate them\" while it still can. Daniela Amodei is betting it can. She's built her whole company around that conviction.  to learn more.",

                "full_text": "In this article All computing devices require a part called memory, or RAM, for short-term data storage, but this year, there won't be enough of these essential components to meet worldwide demand. That's because companies like  ,   and   need so much RAM for their artificial intelligence chips, and those companies are the first ones in line for the components.  Three primary memory vendors —  , SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics — make up nearly the entire RAM market, and their businesses are benefitting from the surge in demand.  We have seen a very sharp, significant surge in demand for memory, and it has far outpaced our ability to supply that memory and, in our estimation, the supply capability of the whole memory industry,\" Micron business chief Sumit Sadana told CNBC this week at the CES trade show in Las Vegas.  Micron's stock is up 247% over the past year, and the company reported that net income   in the most recent quarter.   that it expects its December quarter operating profit to nearly triple as well. Meanwhile,   as its stock price in South Korea surges, and in October, the company said it had secured demand  .  Now, prices for memory are rising.  TrendForce, a Taipei-based researcher that closely covers the memory market, this week said it expects average DRAM memory prices to rise between 50% and 55% this quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2025. TrendForce analyst Tom Hsu told CNBC that type of increase for memory prices was \"unprecedented.\"  Chipmakers like Nvidia surround the part of the chip that does the computation — the graphics processing unit, or GPU — with several blocks of a fast, specialized component called high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, Sadana said. HBM is often visible when chipmakers hold up their new chips. Micron supplies memory to both Nvidia and AMD, the two leading GPU makers.  Nvidia's Rubin GPU, which recently entered production, comes with up to 288 gigabytes of next-generation HBM4 memory per chip. HBM is installed in eight visible blocks above and below the processor, and that GPU will be sold as part of single server rack called NVL72, which fittingly combines 72 of those GPUs into a single system. By comparison, smartphones typically come with 8 or 12GB of lower-powered DDR memory. But the HBM memory that AI chips need is much more demanding than the RAM used for consumers' laptops and smartphones. HBM is designed for high-bandwidth specifications required by AI chips, and it's produced in a complicated process where Micron stacks 12 to 16 layers of memory on a single chip, turning it into a \"cube.\" When Micron makes one bit of HBM memory, it has to forgo making three bits of more conventional memory for other devices. \"As we increase HBM supply, it leaves less memory left over for the non-HBM portion of the market, because of this three-to-one basis,\" Sadana said.  Hsu, the TrendForce analyst, said that memory makers are favoring server and HBM applications over other clients because there's higher potential for growth in demand in that business and cloud service providers are less price-sensitive.  In December, Micron said it would   a part of its business that aimed to provide memory for consumer PC builders so the company could save supply for AI chips and servers.  Some inside the tech industry are marveling at how much and how quickly the price of RAM for consumers has increased.  Dean Beeler, co-founder and tech chief at Juice Labs, said that a few months ago, he loaded up his computer with 256GB of RAM, the maximum amount that current consumer motherboards support. That cost him about $300 at the time.  \"Who knew that would end up being ~$3,000 of RAM just a few months later,\" he posted on Facebook on Monday. AI researchers started to see memory as a bottleneck just before   ChatGPT hit the market in late 2022, said Majestic Labs co-founder Sha Rabii, an entrepreneur who previously worked on silicon at Google and  . Prior AI systems were designed for models like convolutional neural networks, which require less memory than large language models, or LLMs, that are popular today, Rabii said.   While AI chips themselves have been getting much faster, memory has not, he said, which leads to powerful GPUs waiting around to get the data needed to run LLMs.  \"Your performance is limited by the amount of memory and the speed of the memory that you have, and if you keep adding more GPUs, it's not a win,\" Rabii said.  The AI industry refers to this as the \"memory wall.\"  \"The processor spends more time just twiddling its thumbs, waiting for data,\" Micron's Sadana said. More and faster memory means that AI systems can run bigger models, serve more customers simultaneously and add \"context windows\" that allow chatbots and other LLMs to remember previous conversations with users, which adds a touch of personalization to the experience.  Majestic Labs is   an AI system for inference with 128 terabytes of memory, or about 100 times more memory than some current AI systems, Rabii said, adding that the company plans to eschew HBM memory for lower-cost options. Rabii said the additional RAM and architecture support in the design will enable its computers to support significantly more users at the same time than other AI servers while using less power. Wall Street has been asking companies in the consumer electronics business, like   and  , how they will handle the memory shortage and if they might be forced to raise prices or cut margins. These days, memory accounts for about 20% of the hardware costs of a laptop, Hsu said. That's up from between 10% and 18% in the first half of 2025.  In October, Apple finance chief Kevan Parekh told analysts that his company was seeing a \"slight tailwind\" on memory prices but he downplayed it as \"nothing really to note there.\" But in November, Dell said it expected its cost basis for all of its products to go up as a result of the memory shortage. COO Jefferey Clarke told analysts that Dell planned to change its mix of configurations to minimize the price impacts, but he said the shortage will likely affect retail prices for devices.  \"I don't see how this will not make its way into the customer base,\" Clarke said. \"We'll do everything we can to mitigate that.\" Even Nvidia, which has emerged as the biggest customer in the HBM market, is facing questions about its ravenous memory needs — in particular, about its consumer products. At a press conference Tuesday at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was asked if he was concerned that the company's gaming customers might be resentful of AI technology because of rising game console and graphics cards prices that are being driven by the memory shortage.  Huang said Nvidia is a very large customer of memory and has long relationships with the companies in the space but that, ultimately, there would need to be more memory factories because the needs of AI are so high. \"Because our demand is so high, every factory, every HBM supplier, is gearing up, and they're all doing great,\" Huang said.  At most, Micron can only meet two-thirds of the medium-term memory requirements for some customers, Sadana said. But the company is currently building two big factories called fabs in Boise, Idaho, that will start producing memory in 2027 and 2028, he said. Micron is also going to break ground on a fab in the town of Clay, New York, that he said is expect to come online in 2030. But for now, \"we're sold out for 2026,\" Sadana said.",

Jay Jacobs, BlackRock's head of equity exchange-traded funds, laid out ways in which ETFs fit into the shifting market bets from the world's largest asset manager, which oversees more than $13 trillion from investors. Investors should remain focused on growth, he says, but precision will matter more than broad exposure. \"The first is really what are the biggest growth opportunities in the market today,\" Jacobs said on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" on Monday. \"Where you have to get laser focused to try and find some of these targeted exposures, like artificial intelligence, that could do very well in this environment.\" That and the other investing themes Jacobs shared on \"ETF Edge\" are consistent with  , \"AI, income & diversifiers,\" which was released earlier this week. BlackRock continues to view AI as a long-term, capital intensive investment cycle.  , while productivity gains and earnings growth are backed by AI-related investments. The firm does not see the theme as nearing exhaustion. BlackRock is among the ETF companies offering AI-focused funds, such as its iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF ( ), which has amassed over $8 billion in assets.  There are many other AI ETF options that have grown to over $1 billion in assets in recent years: Jacobs cited the U.S. equity market's high level of concentration, with a handful of mega-cap tech stocks now accounting for an outsized share of returns, as among the reasons to fine-tune equities exposure. The \" \" stocks make up over 40% of the   Index. \"[That concentration] is either a feature or a bug,\" Jacobs said. \"It's reaching historical levels.\" Jacobs said investors are responding by becoming more deliberate about how much concentration they want. Some are choosing to broaden their exposure by   as a way to manage the risk. Jacobs cited the interest-rate environment, and expectations the  , as a reason to make income a major focus this year as the declining rates  . Investors who relied on money markets for income may need to reposition. \"We are in a falling interest rate environment. We expect some cuts this year. We need to find new sources of income to diversify your portfolio and generate income from it,\" Jacobs said. Diversification is the third pillar of BlackRock's 2026 approach to the market. Bouts of volatility are becoming more frequent while market leadership is narrow, and traditional portfolio design that rely on bonds to smooth out the risks from stocks — typically the   — are proving less reliable during periods of stress. As a result, Jacobs said investors are looking for assets that behave differently. \"Where can you really get diversification for your portfolio?\" he said. \"Something that's going to behave differently from stocks and bonds.\" The underlying message from Jacobs was that investors have been very fortunate over the past decade with a U.S. stock market that has produced significant returns, but it would be risky to expect that run to continue at a similar pace. \"The last 10 years, the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 13.5%, and many expect it to be lower,\" he said.",

                "full_text": "SAN FRANCISCO —   has an energy that's hard to place — warm, unhurried, immediately present. She swept into a sunlit room on the ground floor of  's headquarters in December, sat down, and immediately apologized for her mug. \"Is my, like, gigantic novelty mug going to be distracting if I have it?\" she said. \"I'll defer to the wise camera people in terms of what's in the shot.\" It was a disarming kind of normal for someone operating at this level. Five years ago, she and her brother, Anthropic CEO  , led an exodus from  . They took a core group of senior researchers and started Anthropic with a contrarian bet: That safety and business success weren't in tension, that the real money wasn't in viral consumer products, and that the   race would be won by the company that knew when to slow down. \"We really just felt more like we were running towards something than running away from something,\" Daniela said of the decision to leave.  The co-founders had known each other for years before OpenAI. Her brother and co-founders Tom Brown and Chris Olah worked together at   Brain. Others overlapped at various labs.  Anthropic's headquarters is on \"AI Alley\" in San Francisco, a 230,000-square-foot glass high-rise in the shadow of   Tower. The neighborhood is a corridor of startups and tech giants reshaping the American economy from a handful of downtown blocks. Anthropic is now valued at $183 billion and on track to nearly double that, according to a newly signed term sheet, with   and   joining its cap table.  Revenue has grown ten times annually for three consecutive years, thanks in large part to the fact that the company's AI assistant, Claude, has become the model of choice for enterprises that care about reliability as much as capability. Daniela Amodei mentioned, almost in passing, that Claude once helped diagnose her with a bacterial infection after multiple doctors missed it. With her human-scale, here-and-now energy, she is by most counts the opposite of the AI founder archetype personified by OpenAI's   and  /xAI CEO  . Even her brother is a version of the technical visionary who speaks in timelines to superintelligence and treats interviews like TED talks. But Daniela Amodei is different. If her brother is the one looking for a path to the horizon, she is pouring the foundation that lets him get there. In November 2022, OpenAI fired the starting gun in the AI race. ChatGPT, a free chatbot anyone could talk to, went viral instantly, hitting 100 million users in two months.  Google scrambled.   went all in. The entire tech industry lurched into motion. But Anthropic didn't sprint.  From the start, Anthropic was defined by a contrarian posture toward OpenAI: move slower, ship later, and optimize for trust. While ChatGPT became a flashy consumer toy, the Amodeis made a different bet. They believed that the real money wasn't in viral moments, but in the less glamorous enterprise buildout behind them. It was in Fortune 500 contracts, developer tools, and APIs sold to companies where reliability, security, and compliance are mission critical. \"I wouldn't necessarily say that we knew for sure,\" Daniela Amodei told CNBC about the enterprise bet. \"Anthropic, as an organization, is well suited to be a B2B company. We really care about things like reliability and security and safety. That's baked into our DNA.\"  Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, said the AI frontier has shifted toward real work — coding, math, science — the kinds of tasks companies will actually pay for.  \"The frontier isn't about making our chat better,\" he said, pointing to Anthropic's strength with developers, where Claude has built a reputation as a top-tier programming model, outpacing key rivals in many users' workflows. Even back in 2020, Daniela Amodei said the team could see a future where Claude would handle many of the high-intelligence tasks humans do at work. \"And we thought, that's a pretty big market.\"  its business customer base has grown from under 1,000 to more than 300,000 in two years, and nearly 80% of Claude activity now comes from outside the United States.  The   reads like a who's who of global enterprise, with  , the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund — the world's largest — plus Bridgewater, Stripe, and Slack, all running Claude at scale. Sameer Dholakia, a partner at Bessemer Ventures who invested in Anthropic, said the bet made sense for one simple reason: enterprise customers don't churn the way consumers do. \"We really love the focus that they had, and candidly, the focus of Anthropic on safety and trust, we knew was going to play really well with the enterprise buyer, and that's proven to be true.\" While OpenAI still leads in scale and cultural cachet, with ChatGPT a household name boasting nearly 900 million weekly active users, Anthropic is closing the gap fast — and in some areas is already ahead. Today, Anthropic's revenue is roughly 85% business. OpenAI is more than 60% consumer. \"One of the values and the things that we talk about a lot internally is just how not to believe the hype,\" Daniela Amodei told CNBC. \"For us, it's never been about seeking attention or sort of being in the headlines. We're really here to do the work.\" \"As Anthropic goes, so goes generative AI,\" said Alex Kantrowitz, founder of the independent publication Big Technology. \"They have the most pure bet on this technology working. If Anthropic is able to make it work, all of GenAI is going to work. And if not, we're going to have some serious problems.\" Anthropic's lead in enterprise is proving durable. And it's a lead the Amodei siblings have built together. \"It's genuinely a privilege to run Anthropic with my sibling,\" Daniela Amodei said. \"We've known each other our whole lives — or my whole life, at least. He had four years without me, poor guy.\" \"Dario and I really help each other,\" she added. \"He's great at pushing me to think about the big picture... I am helpful in thinking about, like, how do we build an organization that is enduring, that's sustainable, that's filled with great people who really want to do the type of work that we set out to do five years ago.\" There's always more work to do, Amodei said, and the models are getting exponentially smarter. She framed it as a lesson from the last generation of tech: If social media companies could go back in time, knowing what their platforms would unleash, would they have done anything differently?  Anthropic, she said, is trying to answer that question now: \"To talk about the risks and try to mitigate them\" while it still can. Daniela Amodei is betting it can. She's built her whole company around that conviction.  to learn more.",

                "full_text": "In this article  has identified itself as the mystery company behind a prospective data center in a part of Michigan where locals have objected to such a development.  On Wednesday, Microsoft's cloud infrastructure team was named in a  , published by Lowell Charter Township, as the party eyeing a 237-acre lot beside Interstate 96. The township, with a population of around 6,500, is located 20 miles southeast of Grand Rapids. The letter came after weeks of speculation about who was collaborating with developer Franklin Partners for the controversial project. Franklin, based in Illinois, had previously said it was working with a national company based in the U.S. to build a data center on the land.  In December, locals crowded into a planning commission meeting, where a public hearing on the proposed rezoning was on the agenda, leading to the postponement of the event. News outlet   reported that a Grand Rapids business owner appeared in a Mr. Peanut costume and held up a sign saying \"This is nuts.\"  Some in the area have said the township was moving too quickly to rezone the land, given the absence of clarity surrounding issues like energy requirements to operate the facility. Days after the canceled meeting, local officials said they were temporarily holding off on moving forward with the project. \"We are introducing ourselves now because we have observed that the community would like more information about the proposal, and we believe it is important to be transparent about our intentions moving forward,\" Microsoft said in Wednesday's letter. \"We asked the seller to pause the rezone process so that we could spend time with the community early this year and share more about our potential long-term plans before we proceed.\" Microsoft is set to nearly double the size of its data center portfolio in the next two years, CEO   told analysts in October. It's among a group of industry heavyweights, including  ,  ,  ,  , OpenAI and   xAI, rushing to spin up data centers packed with   graphics processing units and other infrastructure needed to run powerful artificial intelligence models and workloads.  Tech's megacaps are collectively committing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to capital expenditures, raising concerns that they're fueling another industry bubble.  Utilities in some U.S. markets have said they won't be able to supply the energy needed for these planned data centers, which has made site selection more difficult. Residents living near the sites of proposed facilities have been  , citing a range of concerns. Water   is one of the key issues. The Michigan township said it has an agreement with the nearby city of Lowell to provide a path for increased \"capacity of the plant at no additional cost to rate payers.\" Consumers Energy, a utility serving millions of Michiganders,   data centers will not lead to higher electricity rates. The lot in the Covenant Business Park in the township is zoned as industrial planned unit development, and has sat empty, in part because of a lack of water and sewer services. The township's board would have to approve to change the zoning to light industrial for the project to advance. The development would result in $500 million to $1 billion in investment over the course of three to five years, the township said. The planning commission is set to meet again on Jan. 12.",

Musk and Altman co-founded OpenAI as a nonprofit research company alongside several other researchers and executives in 2015. Musk   from OpenAI's board in 2018 after trying to convince Altman to let his autos business,  , acquire the AI nonprofit. In the lawsuit, Musk alleged he agreed to start the company because he was promised that it would \"chart a safer, more open course than profit-driven tech giants,\" according to  . \"The hearing confirms what we've maintained from the outset — there is substantial evidence that OpenAI's leadership made knowingly false assurances to Mr. Musk about its charitable mission that they never honored in favor of their personal self-enrichment,\" Toberoff said. OpenAI has repeatedly denied the claims, and lawyers for the company have filed a motion to dismiss the case. The Tesla CEO alleges in the suit that he was \"assiduously manipulated\" and \"deceived\" after OpenAI established an \"opaque web of for-profit OpenAI affiliates,\" including its multibillion-dollar partnership with  , and explored converting to a for-profit entity, the filing states.  He claimed Altman and the other defendants have been \"unjustly enriched to the tune of billions of dollars in value.\" A spokesperson for OpenAI said Thursday that Musk's lawsuit \"continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment.\" \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever,\" the spokesperson said.  Gonzalez Rogers said Wednesday that the case would head to trial, according to the  . The judge said she still needed to determine some of the logistics as to how that trial will be set up. Microsoft is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, as Musk alleges the company aided and abetted OpenAI's breach of fiduciary duty. A representative for Microsoft did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. The lawsuit was filed in August 2024 in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California.  In 2024, OpenAI announced plans to convert into a  , which would have wrested control from the nonprofit and kept it as a separate arm. After facing pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees, OpenAI said its nonprofit would retain control. The startup announced   in October, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business.  As part of that recapitalization, Microsoft holds an investment in OpenAI's for-profit arm valued at around $135 billion.  Musk has long warned about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence and the risks it could pose for humanity, and launched his own   company called xAI in 2023. He competes directly with OpenAI,  , Anthropic and other AI players.  XAI started as a for-profit, \"benefit corporation\" with an obligation to deliver environmental and social benefits through its work. The company dropped that obligation and its benefit corporation status in 2025 when Musk merged xAI with his social network X. Musk has come under fire in recent weeks after the company's chatbot and image generator, Grok, allowed users to easily create and share what's known as \"deepfake porn,\" or nonconsensual intimate images of real-life women, and AI-generated images depicting child sexual abuse.  X and xAI are facing regulatory probes over the images by the European Commission, India, Malaysia and Australia.",

Considering the latest payrolls data alongside the   and   reports released this week, Anthony Saglimbene of Ameriprise Financial believes the consensus around the U.S. employment backdrop is that it has \"softened\" but is also \"remaining firm.\" This reflects a \"low-hire, low-fire\" environment, he added. \"What could have been a risk is that you could have seen employment fall off a little bit more than expected, and I think that would have maybe kind of concerned investors,\" the chief market strategist said. \"We get through the week on the employment side with mostly as-expected numbers, which I think is a positive.\" The December report was the first month of jobs figures unaffected by the record-setting U.S. government shutdown.

Analyst Faham Baig expects Altria's earnings-per-share-growth to accelerate and noted the stock's relatively low valuation. \"We believe the worst of Altria's cigarette volume decline could be behind, and expect an improvement in 2026; helped partly by better industry volumes, and price investment that could stabilise group volume share,\" he said in a note to clients. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% on Friday to reach 6,968.42, a fresh all-time intraday high. This marks the third time this week that the broad market index has hit a new intraday record.

Still, the new target implies nearly 24% upside from Thursday's close.  Analyst Eric Sheridan expects Netflix's earnings, due Jan. 20, to reflect a solid end to 2025 as the company continues to execute well. In addition, the company has the potential to significantly increase its scale of operations, as well as address rising competition, with the Warner Bros. deal, he noted.  \"That said (& beyond this earnings report), we expect investors to need greater clarity on a number of areas before the stock can garner a multiple re-rating and/or a revisiting of the long-term compounded revenue and operating profit growth potential that exists within either NFLX standalone or the combined entity (depending on a successful execution of the transaction),\" Sheridan said in a note to clients.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday could rule on the legality of President  's tariffs, a decision poised to have far-reaching impacts on not only trade policy, but also the U.S. fiscal situation. Though it's not certain that the high court will make its ruling, it has scheduled Friday as a \"decision day\" for handing down opinions, and there is widespread speculation that the tariff case will come up. At its core, the ruling will address two issues: whether the administration can use   to levy the tariffs, and if it isn't proper, if the U.S. will have to reimburse those importers who already have paid the duties. However, the final decision could also fall somewhere in between.  . The three major averages opened Friday's session in positive territory.

The analyst cited other catalysts as well such as a potential reduction in residential clean energy EBITDA drag and cyclical improvements in core C&I.

                "full_text": "A million bubbles were swirling inside each glass of Champagne poured on New Year's Eve — which seems about like the number of times artificial intelligence bubbles have been mentioned by tech investors, economists and media pundits in recent months.   surrounds stocks within the Magnificent 7 — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — as well as   and Softbank and other tech companies' multi-billion-dollar investments in the   to power their AI systems. Data centers are expected to require roughly   by 2030, according to a report by McKinsey & Co. The bubble speculations rage almost daily as breaking news and earnings reports send Mag 7 stock prices rising and falling, leading analysts to constantly update their buy, sell or hold recommendations. That's essentially the 30,000-foot, macroeconomic view of AI from Wall Street's bulls and bears. For a zoomed-in, micro look at the volatility surrounding AI, there may be no better example of adjacent players in the space than  .  A one-time privately funded startup darling from Silicon Valley's initial push into renewable energy which grabbed some marquee customers early on (e.g. Google and Walmart), Bloom was often in the red since its founding in 2001. Following its 2018 IPO at a price of $15 per share, it has been an unremarkable stock, trading near that IPO price as recently as last April. But Bloom has skyrocketed roughly 400% over the past year, ignited by its emergence as a standalone, onsite power supplier for electricity-guzzling AI data centers. It uses stacks of solid oxide fuel cells to provide an immediate, always-on alternative to connecting to public utilities' strained grids. Bloom is now among the priciest energy stocks, at 125 times forward earnings. Bloom's performance chart for 2025 resembles one depicting the elevation trajectory from flat, mile-high Denver west to 12,000-foot-high Rocky Mountain National Park. The stock price had come back down to Earth lately — from a 52-week high of $147.86 in November on the strength of strong third-quarter earnings and a major deal with utility giant  . But it continues to fluctuate in reaction to good and bad news regarding its AI customers, with the latest boost coming on Thursday.  Bloom's stock soared on Thursday and Friday with the news that a Wyoming data center project had won a key approval. The 1.8 GW facility is expected to include 900 MW of Bloom's fuel cells, representing about $3 billion in revenue for the company in coming years, according to an analysis from Morgan Stanley's David Arcaro. In a related development, AEP announced a $2.65 billion deal to acquire a substantial portion of Bloom's fuel cells as part of a deal with an unnamed customer, presumably the same Wyoming data center.  With the two-day spike, Bloom's stock rose roughly 30% last week, closing over $134 on Friday with a valuation near $32 billion.  Bloom's profitability remains much more modest than its revenue or stock growth. On October 28, the company reported third-quarter revenue of $519 million, up 57% year over year. It posted a net profit of $7.8 million, compared to a $9.7 million loss a year earlier. On Wall Street,   in the narrative, and that has paid off handsomely for investors, but there are skeptics. Across the 26 analysts covering Bloom, five hold sell or strong sell ratings. The average price target of $115 per share — although below its current share price after last week's rapid runup — remains well above bearish bets, such as Jefferies' price target of $53. San Jose-based Bloom has installed its proprietary fuel cells — which primarily run on liquid natural gas, but also biogas and hydrogen, resulting in lower emissions — at more than 1,200 facilities covering a swath of industries, including manufacturing, retail, health care, biotech and telecom, since 2008. In addition to Walmart and Google, initial customers included Google, Coca-Cola, Cox Enterprises, FedEx, and Staples.  In July 2024,  , a cloud-computing company that has risen over 90% since its 2025 IPO and is  , became Bloom's first AI data center partner, joined since by Oracle,   and AEP. At the dizzying rate that data centers are being built in the U.S., there's no end in sight for electricity needed to power them.  \"Bloom Energy has 1.5 gigawatts of fuel cells deployed globally,\" said Aman Joshi, the company's chief commercial officer, with more than 400 megawatts devoted to data centers. \"Equinix, our flagship customer, has more than 100 megawatts deployed across 20 sites.\"  Bloom is currently producing 1 GW of fuel cell capacity at its lone manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, Joshi said, and \"we've publicly announced we are doing 2 gigawatts [by December 2026].\" There are nearly 3,800 data centers are in the U.S, according to  , an industry resource for data center research. Through 2028, another 280 or so are expected to come online. The Bank of America Institute has reported that   annually over the next decade, five times faster than the growth rate over the past decade. The sustainability of Bloom's stock price will rely on continued revenue growth and improved profitability, but at a macro level, access to capital to scale up production of fuel cells, and ability to compete with other power providers — all of which are predicated on the continued surge in data center construction.  Bloom is expected to report its fourth quarter and full-year earnings for 2025 on Feb. 26. Some analysts contend that the real bottleneck in the data center buildout is power, or as OpenAI CFO Sara Friar put it to CNBC last September, \"The real bottleneck isn't money. It's power.\".  \"The bubble AI companies are facing is going to be who has planned logistically to connect their facility to power infrastructure, and maybe even further downstream to fuel infrastructure for that power,\" said Zachary Krause, an energy analyst at East Daley Analytics who covers the data center industry. \"And that's why I don't think Bloom is on the bubble. Their business model is very strong right now.\" In addition to the lucrative deals Bloom signed with hyperscalers last year, in October it entered into   with  , the world's largest AI infrastructure investor, to deploy Bloom's fuel cell technology, with Bloom CEO KR Sridhar describing the company as \"the preferred onsite provider for Brookfield's trillion-dollar infrastructure portfolio\" during its October earnings call. \"Brookfield has invested $50 billion in AI opportunities and is tripling the size of its AI strategy over the next three years,\" he said on the call. The deal creates multiple benefits for Bloom, according to Oppenheimer analysts, including higher sales. The concentration of Bloom fuel cells will provide service efficiencies, the analysts wrote in a research note, while Brookfield can help provide financing for customers looking to lease fuel cells. \"We expect all of these dynamics to support above-consensus sales growth and margin expansion,\" they said. Evercore analysts said that the joint venture confirms Bloom's ability to be an essential player in the energy buildout to support AI. It underscores a key point for the industry, which is \"speed to power is paramount,\" they wrote. While the most recent quarterly results came in above expectations, Wall Street bears have pointed to aggressive assumptions about the way these deals will play out in the years ahead. The rapid rise in shares in the latter part of this past week was similar in magnitude to what occurred after the Brookfield deal was announced. At that time, Bank of America analyst team, who have held a sell rating on Bloom Energy, said they see risk in a Street that is \"assuming 5-yr perfection\" and viewing these deals as a near-term earnings catalyst rather than as gradual deployments.  \"A strategic win, yes — but the market is paying today for a decade of delivery,\" Bank of America analysts wrote in an October research note. \"Investors continue to treat Bloom's major customer announcements as additive backlog rather than potential pipelines. ... we view that as aggressive,\" they wrote. Bank of America did raise its price target from $26 to $39 after the most recent earnings though it still rates the stock at a sell. In late December, Bloom received another capital infusion, securing a $600-million multi-currency credit facility with Wells Fargo. It will permit cash withdrawn from the facility to finance capex, including international projects, such as in South Korea, where Bloom has a distribution agreement in place with SK Ecoplant. With those capital resources, plus around $595 million in cash reserves as of September 30, Joshi foresees no financial constraints in scaling up to 2 GW this year. \"Our fuel cells are printed,\" he said, adding that \"our raw material sources are extremely diversified. It's just a matter of us [adding] one more printing line, which will take about $100-$150 million of investment.\" In fact, Bloom has been able to lower costs by about 10% every year, said UBS analyst Manav Gupta, \"and they are very confident they can increase from these levels because, until now, the economies of scale have not kicked in.\" The Fremont production facility can be expanded up to 5 GW of production capacity, he said, although \"KR is the kind of person who will not add capacity until he sees the orders,\" Gupta said. He anticipates that Oracle and AEP will upsize their fuel cell orders in the next few months, and that Google, Microsoft or Meta will soon sign on as new data center customers. (As Bloom's very first customer, Google only used it to power a portion of its headquarters in Mountain View, California.) \"Those are the near-term catalysts that I'm looking for,\" Gupta said. Analysts in general expect Bloom to report an even stronger fourth quarter, ending 2025 with $1.9 billion in sales and forecasting $2.46 billion this year, but volatility is likely to remain part of the stock story. Indeed, Bloom shares have experienced 76 moves greater than 5% over the last year. Thursday and Friday's upturn exemplified the stock's rollercoaster ride, starkly contrasted against last year's low of $15.15 on April 9. Bloom's shares fell 17.3% in November, even as fundamentals remained strong. On December 4, shares spiked more than 13% intraday. Four days later, the stock fell 6.2%, while still being up 24% over the prior two weeks. In terms of competition, Bloom is considered the go-to for standalone power for data centers.  's hydrogen fuel cells are considerably more expensive to operate vs. LNG, so they are installed mostly as a backup source. Gupta dismissed   as a rival, saying it \"is probably 10 or maybe 15 years behind on technology from where Bloom was 10 years ago.\" Both of those stocks have seen significant losses in share price over the past year. Another 2025 stock boomer,  , has LNG turbines that are utilized as backup power sources at data centers, and an 80 GW backlog of orders, which will take the company into 2029 to fulfill, CEO Scott Strazik recently told investors. In the meantime, however, GE Vernova is developing fuel cell technology, different from Bloom's, that it expects to offer data centers in two to three years. Longer-term, industry watchers expect that   — large, traditional facilities and small modular reactors — as well as wind and solar sources, backed up by more efficient storage batteries, will be viable options for powering data centers. There's even talk of building solar-powered  . Those options are years away from being fully developed, though, making Bloom a right-now power solution for data center operators. \"They have a good first-mover advantage in gaining entrenchment, where they're going to see a huge spike in use,\" Krause said. For investors, especially after the run the stock has already been on, Bloom is a market bet that requires deep conviction. \"This is not a stock for the faint of heart,\" said Andrew Rocco, an analyst at Zacks Investment Research. It's going to be volatile, he said, but added, \"I expect these guys to grow high double digits or even triple digits over the next two to three years.\"",

The men's   market is now one of the most lucrative — and largely untapped — growth opportunities left in beauty, and specialty retailers like   and   along with big-box companies like   and   all see opportunity.  \"Men's beauty is one of the last categories left where brands can likely still see easy double-digit growth potential simply by showing up,\" said Delphine Horvath, professor of cosmetics and fragrance marketing at the Fashion Institute of Technology.  Men's grooming sales in the United States topped $7.1 billion in 2025, up 6.9% year over year, according to market research firm  . The global market was valued at $61.6 billion in 2024 and projected to surpass $85 billion by 2032, with the biggest growth driven by the skin-care sector, according to  . Much of the momentum is coming from Gen Z. In the U.S., 68% of Gen Z men ages 18 to 27 used facial skin-care products in 2024, a sharp jump from 42% just two years earlier, according to data from market intelligence firm  . \"This is no longer niche,\" said Linda Dang, CEO of Canada-based Asian beauty retailer Sukoshi. \"Men are forming routines, that usually starts at skin care and then expands further, they are no longer just buying random products. That's what makes this market so valuable.\" Unlike one-off grooming purchases, makeup encourages repeat use and experimentation. A man who starts with concealer often adds primer, setting powder or tinted SPF over time, said Farah Jemai, global marketing associate lead at beauty brand  .  \"When men discover makeup that works, they don't use once and never again,\" Jemai told CNBC. \"They restock.\" Market researchers estimate that in 2022, about 15% of U.S. heterosexual men ages 18 to 65 were already using cosmetics and makeup, while another 17% said they would consider it, according to  . Industry experts say those figures are likely higher in 2026. Openness to cosmetics has grown, as the share of U.S. men who say they never wear makeup has fallen from more than 90% in 2019 to about 75% in 2024,   survey data show. Beauty conglomerates and startups alike are responding to the growth in men's beauty.   and and   have begun integrating men's complexion products into gender-neutral, skin care-first displays rather than having \"Men's\" aisles. Those gender-specific displays can feel intimidating or stigmatizing to some men, Horvath said. Big-box retailers like   and   have also expanded their men's cosmetics or grooming offerings. For example, in 2025, Target partnered with online streaming collective  , Any Means Possible, to  . The men‑forward personal care brand debuted in Target stores nationwide in July, leveraging AMP's massive Gen Z male following across   and  . Online — where much of the growth and discovery is happening — many beauty brands are pouring money into influencer partnerships to increase engagement and sales on   and  . \"So many brands are now putting most of their marketing budget into influencer marketing to meet people where they already are online and make it easier to click 'buy,'\" said Janet Kim, a vice president at K-beauty brand  . Others are leaning into digital education to teach men what different items do. The brand   sells makeup products like concealer pens, tinted moisturizers and anti-shine powders that feature QR codes on the packaging. Scanning them launches video tutorials explaining what each product does — without forcing customers to ask questions in a store. \"The biggest barrier isn't price, it's uncertainty,\" Dang said. \"Men want to know what a product does and how to use it without feeling awkward.\" But the path to mass adoption isn't guaranteed.  Industry analysts warn that social stigma remains high and inflation threatens to curb spending on experimental, nonessential goods. Retailers also face a steep learning curve: It is difficult to scale a market when the core customer doesn't know how to use the product. While men have worn makeup for centuries, from ancient Egypt to Elizabethan England, the modern commercial men's makeup movement traces its roots to the mid-2010s. In 2016, CoverGirl made history by appointing then 17-year-old YouTuber   as its first-ever \" ,\" placing a male face on a mass-market cosmetics brand for the first time. Still, beauty conglomerates largely focused on women until recently, Sukoshi's Dang said. Now, a broader cultural reset around masculinity is taking place and companies are racing to monetize it, FIT's Horvath said. Social media has been the single biggest accelerant, Dang said. On TikTok and Instagram,   post  , product breakdowns and before-and-after results that often emphasize subtle changes rather than dramatic looks. Hashtags tied to men's grooming and makeup have amassed billions of views, with   alone surpassing 26 billion views on  . \"TikTok democratized the 'how-to,'\" said Dang. \"You don't have to ask your sister or guess anymore. You just scroll, see a guy who looks like you fixing his acne in 30 seconds, and click 'buy.' It removed the gatekeepers.\" Gen Z men are also more comfortable rejecting rigid gender categories and more skeptical of marketing that frames products as inherently masculine or feminine, Horvath said. At the same time, makeup has increasingly been folded into a broader   — sometimes referred to as \"looksmaxxing\" — that includes fitness tracking, supplements, hair-loss prevention and longevity routines. \"Many men have started framing grooming and, for some, makeup as maintenance, not vanity,\" Horvath said. \"That reframing removes stigma and unlocks spending.\" Celebrity influence has further accelerated adoption, with stars like  ,   and   launching their own skin care and makeup brands, mirroring the trend of celebrity saturation largely seen in spirits. Johnson's brand   which launched at   in 2024 and spans skin, hair, body and tattoo care, was created in response to ongoing questions about his grooming regimen. It now competes directly with legacy names like Clinique, L'Oréal and Kiehl's. As the market matures, a debate is forming: Do men want \"men's makeup,\" or do they just want makeup? Horvath said there is a \"bifurcation\" in how companies are marketing their products. Brands like War Paint and   argue that men need products designed for their thicker, oilier skin, and packaged in masculine, tool-like containers that feel at home in a gym bag. But Gen Z consumers are increasingly gravitating toward gender-neutral brands like   co-owned  ,   and  . For them, labels that say \"For Men\" can feel outdated or even patronizing, Horvath said.  \"In ten years, I don't think we'll be talking about 'men's makeup' anymore,\" Horvath said. \"We will just be talking about makeup. The gender binary in beauty is dissolving, and the sales data is finally catching up to the culture.\"",

OpenAI's   developed in partnership with Stripe, is open source and could compete with UCP.  in May said it's partnering with   to let users buy products, book travel and secure concert tickets directly in its chat without leaving the platform, and in November said it will roll out   for U.S. users ahead of the holiday season.  And earlier last year, Amazon launched   a feature that lets consumers browse items from other brands' sites on Amazon. Some of those items include a button labeled   an AI agent that can   from other websites on a shopper's behalf. By 2030, the retail market could represent a $3 trillion to $5 trillion opportunity globally due to AI-powered tools and agentic commerce, according to a   in October from McKinsey.  Google said UCP was co-developed with companies including  ,  ,   and  . The protocol will soon power a new checkout feature allowing users to buy direct from Google's AI Mode or Gemini App. They can pay via Google Wallet, but Srinivasan said the company plans to include other payment methods like PayPal in the future.  Srinivasan said UCP will be compatible with other existing protocols.  As part of Sunday's announcements, Google also introduced a feature called Business Agent, allowing shoppers to chat with brands. \"This is to address the newer consumer behavior which is shifted toward more conversational commerce,\" Srinivasan said. \"We want retailers to be able to connect to users on our surfaces but using their own voice.\" Then there's Google's core market: advertising.  Google said it's testing \"Direct Offers,\" which will let retailers promote unique discounts, such as 20% off of a product, if a user of the AI Mode chatbot expresses intent to buy something.  \"Our role in the ecosystem is that of a matchmaker and one way is with ads,\" Srinivasan said. \"It's a really big focus for us to innovate in the space that adds value to both retailers and buyers.\"",

The airlines' CEOs discussed their proposed combination with Amazon beforehand, he said. The deal has an implied value of  $18.89 for each Sun Country share, a premium of almost 20% over Sun Country's closing stock price of $15.77 on Friday, Allegiant said. Allegiant shareholders would own about 67% of the combined company and Sun Country's shareholders would own around 33%, the airlines said. The deal includes $400 million of Sun Country's net debt. Sun Country and Allegiant each focus on vacationers, particularly to sun-and-beach and other leisure destinations. The deal will test the Trump administration's appetite for an airline merger.  Allegiant's Anderson expressed confidence that the agreement would be approved, noting that the two carriers have little network overlap. The airlines expect the deal to close in the second half of this year. Allegiant approached Sun Country in late fall, Anderson said. If the deal is approved by regulators, Anderson would become CEO of the combined airline. Sun Country CEO Jude Bricker, Allegiant's former chief operating officer, would join Allegiant's board.

                "full_text": "In this article All computing devices require a part called memory, or RAM, for short-term data storage, but this year, there won't be enough of these essential components to meet worldwide demand. That's because companies like  ,   and   need so much RAM for their artificial intelligence chips, and those companies are the first ones in line for the components.  Three primary memory vendors —  , SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics — make up nearly the entire RAM market, and their businesses are benefitting from the surge in demand.  We have seen a very sharp, significant surge in demand for memory, and it has far outpaced our ability to supply that memory and, in our estimation, the supply capability of the whole memory industry,\" Micron business chief Sumit Sadana told CNBC this week at the CES trade show in Las Vegas.  Micron's stock is up 247% over the past year, and the company reported that net income   in the most recent quarter.   that it expects its December quarter operating profit to nearly triple as well. Meanwhile,   as its stock price in South Korea surges, and in October, the company said it had secured demand  .  Now, prices for memory are rising.  TrendForce, a Taipei-based researcher that closely covers the memory market, this week said it expects average DRAM memory prices to rise between 50% and 55% this quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2025. TrendForce analyst Tom Hsu told CNBC that type of increase for memory prices was \"unprecedented.\"  Chipmakers like Nvidia surround the part of the chip that does the computation — the graphics processing unit, or GPU — with several blocks of a fast, specialized component called high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, Sadana said. HBM is often visible when chipmakers hold up their new chips. Micron supplies memory to both Nvidia and AMD, the two leading GPU makers.  Nvidia's Rubin GPU, which recently entered production, comes with up to 288 gigabytes of next-generation HBM4 memory per chip. HBM is installed in eight visible blocks above and below the processor, and that GPU will be sold as part of single server rack called NVL72, which fittingly combines 72 of those GPUs into a single system. By comparison, smartphones typically come with 8 or 12GB of lower-powered DDR memory. But the HBM memory that AI chips need is much more demanding than the RAM used for consumers' laptops and smartphones. HBM is designed for high-bandwidth specifications required by AI chips, and it's produced in a complicated process where Micron stacks 12 to 16 layers of memory on a single chip, turning it into a \"cube.\" When Micron makes one bit of HBM memory, it has to forgo making three bits of more conventional memory for other devices. \"As we increase HBM supply, it leaves less memory left over for the non-HBM portion of the market, because of this three-to-one basis,\" Sadana said.  Hsu, the TrendForce analyst, said that memory makers are favoring server and HBM applications over other clients because there's higher potential for growth in demand in that business and cloud service providers are less price-sensitive.  In December, Micron said it would   a part of its business that aimed to provide memory for consumer PC builders so the company could save supply for AI chips and servers.  Some inside the tech industry are marveling at how much and how quickly the price of RAM for consumers has increased.  Dean Beeler, co-founder and tech chief at Juice Labs, said that a few months ago, he loaded up his computer with 256GB of RAM, the maximum amount that current consumer motherboards support. That cost him about $300 at the time.  \"Who knew that would end up being ~$3,000 of RAM just a few months later,\" he posted on Facebook on Monday. AI researchers started to see memory as a bottleneck just before   ChatGPT hit the market in late 2022, said Majestic Labs co-founder Sha Rabii, an entrepreneur who previously worked on silicon at Google and  . Prior AI systems were designed for models like convolutional neural networks, which require less memory than large language models, or LLMs, that are popular today, Rabii said.   While AI chips themselves have been getting much faster, memory has not, he said, which leads to powerful GPUs waiting around to get the data needed to run LLMs.  \"Your performance is limited by the amount of memory and the speed of the memory that you have, and if you keep adding more GPUs, it's not a win,\" Rabii said.  The AI industry refers to this as the \"memory wall.\"  \"The processor spends more time just twiddling its thumbs, waiting for data,\" Micron's Sadana said. More and faster memory means that AI systems can run bigger models, serve more customers simultaneously and add \"context windows\" that allow chatbots and other LLMs to remember previous conversations with users, which adds a touch of personalization to the experience.  Majestic Labs is   an AI system for inference with 128 terabytes of memory, or about 100 times more memory than some current AI systems, Rabii said, adding that the company plans to eschew HBM memory for lower-cost options. Rabii said the additional RAM and architecture support in the design will enable its computers to support significantly more users at the same time than other AI servers while using less power. Wall Street has been asking companies in the consumer electronics business, like   and  , how they will handle the memory shortage and if they might be forced to raise prices or cut margins. These days, memory accounts for about 20% of the hardware costs of a laptop, Hsu said. That's up from between 10% and 18% in the first half of 2025.  In October, Apple finance chief Kevan Parekh told analysts that his company was seeing a \"slight tailwind\" on memory prices but he downplayed it as \"nothing really to note there.\" But in November, Dell said it expected its cost basis for all of its products to go up as a result of the memory shortage. COO Jefferey Clarke told analysts that Dell planned to change its mix of configurations to minimize the price impacts, but he said the shortage will likely affect retail prices for devices.  \"I don't see how this will not make its way into the customer base,\" Clarke said. \"We'll do everything we can to mitigate that.\" Even Nvidia, which has emerged as the biggest customer in the HBM market, is facing questions about its ravenous memory needs — in particular, about its consumer products. At a press conference Tuesday at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was asked if he was concerned that the company's gaming customers might be resentful of AI technology because of rising game console and graphics cards prices that are being driven by the memory shortage.  Huang said Nvidia is a very large customer of memory and has long relationships with the companies in the space but that, ultimately, there would need to be more memory factories because the needs of AI are so high. \"Because our demand is so high, every factory, every HBM supplier, is gearing up, and they're all doing great,\" Huang said.  At most, Micron can only meet two-thirds of the medium-term memory requirements for some customers, Sadana said. But the company is currently building two big factories called fabs in Boise, Idaho, that will start producing memory in 2027 and 2028, he said. Micron is also going to break ground on a fab in the town of Clay, New York, that he said is expect to come online in 2030. But for now, \"we're sold out for 2026,\" Sadana said.",

Google and Apple didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.  Grok and X have been letting users easily generate and widely share \"deepfake\" explicit, sexualized content that includes people who never gave permission for their images to be used in such manner. Grok has also been used to generate images that denigrate people on the basis of their race or ethnicity. In one recent example, as The Times of London  , \"A descendant of Holocaust survivors was 'digitally stripped'\" by Grok after users prompted the AI tool to generate an image of her in a bikini standing outside of Auschwitz.  The issues have sparked widespread criticism and regulatory probes by foreign governments in Europe, Malaysia, Australia and India. However, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice have yet to say whether they will investigate xAI. On  , Musk and X issued statements saying that \"anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\"  Apple and Google both have stringent guidelines for app developers that would require them to prevent the uploading and sharing of images depicting child sexual abuse, and other explicit or harmful content.  Social media and messaging apps including   and   have been previously suspended by the Apple app store for failures to filter a variety of inappropriate content.

                "full_text": "In this article  came into 2026 with a clear investment plan built around three pillars: artificial intelligence, income, and diversification.  Jay Jacobs, BlackRock's head of equity exchange-traded funds, laid out ways in which ETFs fit into the shifting market bets from the world's largest asset manager, which oversees more than $13 trillion from investors. Investors should remain focused on growth, he says, but precision will matter more than broad exposure. \"The first is really what are the biggest growth opportunities in the market today,\" Jacobs said on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" on Monday. \"Where you have to get laser focused to try and find some of these targeted exposures, like artificial intelligence, that could do very well in this environment.\" That and the other investing themes Jacobs shared on \"ETF Edge\" are consistent with  , \"AI, income & diversifiers,\" which was released earlier this week. BlackRock continues to view AI as a long-term, capital intensive investment cycle.  , while productivity gains and earnings growth are backed by AI-related investments. The firm does not see the theme as nearing exhaustion. BlackRock is among the ETF companies offering AI-focused funds, such as its iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF ( ), which has amassed over $8 billion in assets.  There are many other AI ETF options that have grown to over $1 billion in assets in recent years: Jacobs cited the U.S. equity market's high level of concentration, with a handful of mega-cap tech stocks now accounting for an outsized share of returns, as among the reasons to fine-tune equities exposure. The \" \" stocks make up over 40% of the   Index. \"[That concentration] is either a feature or a bug,\" Jacobs said. \"It's reaching historical levels.\" Jacobs said investors are responding by becoming more deliberate about how much concentration they want. Some are choosing to broaden their exposure by   as a way to manage the risk. Jacobs cited the interest-rate environment, and expectations the  , as a reason to make income a major focus this year as the declining rates  . Investors who relied on money markets for income may need to reposition. \"We are in a falling interest rate environment. We expect some cuts this year. We need to find new sources of income to diversify your portfolio and generate income from it,\" Jacobs said. Diversification is the third pillar of BlackRock's 2026 approach to the market. Bouts of volatility are becoming more frequent while market leadership is narrow, and traditional portfolio design that rely on bonds to smooth out the risks from stocks — typically the   — are proving less reliable during periods of stress. As a result, Jacobs said investors are looking for assets that behave differently. \"Where can you really get diversification for your portfolio?\" he said. \"Something that's going to behave differently from stocks and bonds.\" The underlying message from Jacobs was that investors have been very fortunate over the past decade with a U.S. stock market that has produced significant returns, but it would be risky to expect that run to continue at a similar pace. \"The last 10 years, the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 13.5%, and many expect it to be lower,\" he said.",

The three major averages posted a winning week. The S&P 500 was up more than 1% week to date, while the Dow and Nasdaq jumped 2.3% and 1.9%, respectively. The December jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 50,000 last month, less than the 73,000 that economists polled by Dow Jones had estimated. That data, though slightly weaker than expected, showed a U.S. economy that's still trudging along, with investors anticipating that growth will ramp up. The unemployment rate inched down to 4.4%, while economists had forecast 4.5%. Traders took that as a sign that improvement in the economy would happen soon. Considering the latest payrolls data alongside the   and   reports released this week, Anthony Saglimbene of Ameriprise Financial believes the consensus around the U.S. employment backdrop is that it has \"softened\" but is also \"remaining firm.\" This reflects a \"low-hire, low-fire\" environment, he added. \"What could have been a risk is that you could have seen employment fall off a little bit more than expected, and I think that would have maybe kind of concerned investors,\" the chief market strategist said. \"We get through the week on the employment side with mostly as-expected numbers, which I think is a positive.\" The December report was the first month of jobs figures unaffected by the record-setting U.S. government shutdown. That stoppage posed data collection challenges for the Bureau of Labor Statistics with regards to October and November: The agency said that a full October jobs report  , and the  . \"This nonfarm payrolls report is the first report in a couple months that the data is clean,\" Saglimbene  said. \"Looking at these numbers, it suggests that the Fed probably doesn't need to cut in January, and maybe they don't need to cut in March as well.\" Shares of homebuilders supported the broader market Friday after President Donald Trump   as a way to drive rates down for homebuyers.   jumped nearly 8%, while   traded up more than 7%.   advanced more than 8%. Home improvement stocks such as   also gained. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average finished Friday's session at new heights. The broad market index climbed 0.65% to end at 6,966.28, while the blue-chip Dow closed higher by 237.96 points, or 0.48%, to reach 49,504.07. Those were fresh closing highs for the indexes.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.81% to settle at 23,671.35. Mizuho sees continued upside for semiconductor stocks as the new year begins.  Analyst Vijay Rakesh named  ,   and   the firm's top picks and said he continues to like   a \"key outperformer.\" \"Our top sectors in 2026E are: 1) AI Accelerators and WFE, 2) Optical, and 3) memory(DRAM/NAND), while we remain cautious on I) xEV/Autos/SiC/Analog and II) PC/handsets,\" Rakesh wrote in a Friday note to clients. He said that AI accelerators, specifically, should benefit from accelerating large language model adoption into enterprise workflows, new LLM releases such as upcoming Gemini launches and secular trends in AI demand. \"We see potential for a strong 1H26E as AI spend, WFE and memory cycles all expected to remain strong, powering tier1/2 CSP, enterprise/sovereign AI server ramps. Into 2H26E, we see potential challenges with 1) higher volatility around new product launches/ramps with Rubin/ MI400, 2) US midterm elections (11/3/2026), and 3) slower Fed rate cuts,\" Rakesh said. Small-cap stocks ran circles around the broader market in the first full week of 2026. The small cap-focused   climbed almost 1% on Friday, bringing its gain for the week to more than 4%. By comparison, the broad   has added nearly 2% on the week. This week's advance brought the Russell 2000's advance to above 5% for 2026. That follows several years of underperformance compared to the S&P 500. Shares in mortgage lenders rallied on Friday after President Donald Trump instructed \"representatives\" to purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds in an attempt to lower rates. Mortgage lender   jumped more than 7% and notched a fresh intraday high going back to 2021. Competitor  gained more than 12%, on track for its best day since 2023. Fellow lender   rose about 5%.

The firm also raised its price target to $63 from $61, implying nearly 13% upside from Thursday's close.  Analyst Faham Baig expects Altria's earnings-per-share-growth to accelerate and noted the stock's relatively low valuation. \"We believe the worst of Altria's cigarette volume decline could be behind, and expect an improvement in 2026; helped partly by better industry volumes, and price investment that could stabilise group volume share,\" he said in a note to clients. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% on Friday to reach 6,968.42, a fresh all-time intraday high. This marks the third time this week that the broad market index has hit a new intraday record. The index is currently on track for a 1.6% gain on the week. Goldman Sachs is taking a wait-and-see approach on   ahead of the streaming giant's earnings later this month. The firm, which would like to see more certainty around   of Warner Bros.' film and streaming assets, maintained its neutral rating on the stock and lowered its price target to $112 from $130 on Thursday. Still, the new target implies nearly 24% upside from Thursday's close.  Analyst Eric Sheridan expects Netflix's earnings, due Jan. 20, to reflect a solid end to 2025 as the company continues to execute well. In addition, the company has the potential to significantly increase its scale of operations, as well as address rising competition, with the Warner Bros. deal, he noted.  \"That said (& beyond this earnings report), we expect investors to need greater clarity on a number of areas before the stock can garner a multiple re-rating and/or a revisiting of the long-term compounded revenue and operating profit growth potential that exists within either NFLX standalone or the combined entity (depending on a successful execution of the transaction),\" Sheridan said in a note to clients.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday could rule on the legality of President  's tariffs, a decision poised to have far-reaching impacts on not only trade policy, but also the U.S. fiscal situation. Though it's not certain that the high court will make its ruling, it has scheduled Friday as a \"decision day\" for handing down opinions, and there is widespread speculation that the tariff case will come up. At its core, the ruling will address two issues: whether the administration can use   to levy the tariffs, and if it isn't proper, if the U.S. will have to reimburse those importers who already have paid the duties. However, the final decision could also fall somewhere in between.  . The three major averages opened Friday's session in positive territory.  The S&P 500 rose 0.2% just after 9:30 a.m. ET, while the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 121 points, or 0.3%. Shares of   advanced almost 3% in premarket trading Friday after the name was upgraded to outperform at Baird, with the firm saying that the company has a number of \"unique\" catalysts ahead, including the opportunity presented from commercial and industrial (C&I) diesel generator sets. \"GNRC's expansion into large diesel gensets (2.25-3.25 mW) represents a substantial strategic/financial opportunity serving both datacenter and traditional C&I customers,\" analyst Michael Halloran wrote in a note on Friday. \"Robust early results (~$125m 2Q backlog/orders, doubled to ~$300m in 3Q) highlight the opportunity, with a pathway to substantial upside over the next few years (we estimate ~$400-800m+ in 2027/2028, with consensus at the low end of that range; our 2027 estimate assumes ~$400mln in incremental revenue, which we believe will prove conservative), with the capacity/suppliers/capability in place to execute on that demand,\" he continued. The analyst cited other catalysts as well such as a potential reduction in residential clean energy EBITDA drag and cyclical improvements in core C&I. That marks the second upgrade the stock has received in wo days, as Citi   on Thursday. The U.S. economy added  , far less than expected.

                "full_text": "A million bubbles were swirling inside each glass of Champagne poured on New Year's Eve — which seems about like the number of times artificial intelligence bubbles have been mentioned by tech investors, economists and media pundits in recent months.   surrounds stocks within the Magnificent 7 — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — as well as   and Softbank and other tech companies' multi-billion-dollar investments in the   to power their AI systems. Data centers are expected to require roughly   by 2030, according to a report by McKinsey & Co. The bubble speculations rage almost daily as breaking news and earnings reports send Mag 7 stock prices rising and falling, leading analysts to constantly update their buy, sell or hold recommendations. That's essentially the 30,000-foot, macroeconomic view of AI from Wall Street's bulls and bears. For a zoomed-in, micro look at the volatility surrounding AI, there may be no better example of adjacent players in the space than  .  A one-time privately funded startup darling from Silicon Valley's initial push into renewable energy which grabbed some marquee customers early on (e.g. Google and Walmart), Bloom was often in the red since its founding in 2001. Following its 2018 IPO at a price of $15 per share, it has been an unremarkable stock, trading near that IPO price as recently as last April. But Bloom has skyrocketed roughly 400% over the past year, ignited by its emergence as a standalone, onsite power supplier for electricity-guzzling AI data centers. It uses stacks of solid oxide fuel cells to provide an immediate, always-on alternative to connecting to public utilities' strained grids. Bloom is now among the priciest energy stocks, at 125 times forward earnings. Bloom's performance chart for 2025 resembles one depicting the elevation trajectory from flat, mile-high Denver west to 12,000-foot-high Rocky Mountain National Park. The stock price had come back down to Earth lately — from a 52-week high of $147.86 in November on the strength of strong third-quarter earnings and a major deal with utility giant  . But it continues to fluctuate in reaction to good and bad news regarding its AI customers, with the latest boost coming on Thursday.  Bloom's stock soared on Thursday and Friday with the news that a Wyoming data center project had won a key approval. The 1.8 GW facility is expected to include 900 MW of Bloom's fuel cells, representing about $3 billion in revenue for the company in coming years, according to an analysis from Morgan Stanley's David Arcaro. In a related development, AEP announced a $2.65 billion deal to acquire a substantial portion of Bloom's fuel cells as part of a deal with an unnamed customer, presumably the same Wyoming data center.  With the two-day spike, Bloom's stock rose roughly 30% last week, closing over $134 on Friday with a valuation near $32 billion.  Bloom's profitability remains much more modest than its revenue or stock growth. On October 28, the company reported third-quarter revenue of $519 million, up 57% year over year. It posted a net profit of $7.8 million, compared to a $9.7 million loss a year earlier. On Wall Street,   in the narrative, and that has paid off handsomely for investors, but there are skeptics. Across the 26 analysts covering Bloom, five hold sell or strong sell ratings. The average price target of $115 per share — although below its current share price after last week's rapid runup — remains well above bearish bets, such as Jefferies' price target of $53. San Jose-based Bloom has installed its proprietary fuel cells — which primarily run on liquid natural gas, but also biogas and hydrogen, resulting in lower emissions — at more than 1,200 facilities covering a swath of industries, including manufacturing, retail, health care, biotech and telecom, since 2008. In addition to Walmart and Google, initial customers included Google, Coca-Cola, Cox Enterprises, FedEx, and Staples.  In July 2024,  , a cloud-computing company that has risen over 90% since its 2025 IPO and is  , became Bloom's first AI data center partner, joined since by Oracle,   and AEP. At the dizzying rate that data centers are being built in the U.S., there's no end in sight for electricity needed to power them.  \"Bloom Energy has 1.5 gigawatts of fuel cells deployed globally,\" said Aman Joshi, the company's chief commercial officer, with more than 400 megawatts devoted to data centers. \"Equinix, our flagship customer, has more than 100 megawatts deployed across 20 sites.\"  Bloom is currently producing 1 GW of fuel cell capacity at its lone manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, Joshi said, and \"we've publicly announced we are doing 2 gigawatts [by December 2026].\" There are nearly 3,800 data centers are in the U.S, according to  , an industry resource for data center research. Through 2028, another 280 or so are expected to come online. The Bank of America Institute has reported that   annually over the next decade, five times faster than the growth rate over the past decade. The sustainability of Bloom's stock price will rely on continued revenue growth and improved profitability, but at a macro level, access to capital to scale up production of fuel cells, and ability to compete with other power providers — all of which are predicated on the continued surge in data center construction.  Bloom is expected to report its fourth quarter and full-year earnings for 2025 on Feb. 26. Some analysts contend that the real bottleneck in the data center buildout is power, or as OpenAI CFO Sara Friar put it to CNBC last September, \"The real bottleneck isn't money. It's power.\".  \"The bubble AI companies are facing is going to be who has planned logistically to connect their facility to power infrastructure, and maybe even further downstream to fuel infrastructure for that power,\" said Zachary Krause, an energy analyst at East Daley Analytics who covers the data center industry. \"And that's why I don't think Bloom is on the bubble. Their business model is very strong right now.\" In addition to the lucrative deals Bloom signed with hyperscalers last year, in October it entered into   with  , the world's largest AI infrastructure investor, to deploy Bloom's fuel cell technology, with Bloom CEO KR Sridhar describing the company as \"the preferred onsite provider for Brookfield's trillion-dollar infrastructure portfolio\" during its October earnings call. \"Brookfield has invested $50 billion in AI opportunities and is tripling the size of its AI strategy over the next three years,\" he said on the call. The deal creates multiple benefits for Bloom, according to Oppenheimer analysts, including higher sales. The concentration of Bloom fuel cells will provide service efficiencies, the analysts wrote in a research note, while Brookfield can help provide financing for customers looking to lease fuel cells. \"We expect all of these dynamics to support above-consensus sales growth and margin expansion,\" they said. Evercore analysts said that the joint venture confirms Bloom's ability to be an essential player in the energy buildout to support AI. It underscores a key point for the industry, which is \"speed to power is paramount,\" they wrote. While the most recent quarterly results came in above expectations, Wall Street bears have pointed to aggressive assumptions about the way these deals will play out in the years ahead. The rapid rise in shares in the latter part of this past week was similar in magnitude to what occurred after the Brookfield deal was announced. At that time, Bank of America analyst team, who have held a sell rating on Bloom Energy, said they see risk in a Street that is \"assuming 5-yr perfection\" and viewing these deals as a near-term earnings catalyst rather than as gradual deployments.  \"A strategic win, yes — but the market is paying today for a decade of delivery,\" Bank of America analysts wrote in an October research note. \"Investors continue to treat Bloom's major customer announcements as additive backlog rather than potential pipelines. ... we view that as aggressive,\" they wrote. Bank of America did raise its price target from $26 to $39 after the most recent earnings though it still rates the stock at a sell. In late December, Bloom received another capital infusion, securing a $600-million multi-currency credit facility with Wells Fargo. It will permit cash withdrawn from the facility to finance capex, including international projects, such as in South Korea, where Bloom has a distribution agreement in place with SK Ecoplant. With those capital resources, plus around $595 million in cash reserves as of September 30, Joshi foresees no financial constraints in scaling up to 2 GW this year. \"Our fuel cells are printed,\" he said, adding that \"our raw material sources are extremely diversified. It's just a matter of us [adding] one more printing line, which will take about $100-$150 million of investment.\" In fact, Bloom has been able to lower costs by about 10% every year, said UBS analyst Manav Gupta, \"and they are very confident they can increase from these levels because, until now, the economies of scale have not kicked in.\" The Fremont production facility can be expanded up to 5 GW of production capacity, he said, although \"KR is the kind of person who will not add capacity until he sees the orders,\" Gupta said. He anticipates that Oracle and AEP will upsize their fuel cell orders in the next few months, and that Google, Microsoft or Meta will soon sign on as new data center customers. (As Bloom's very first customer, Google only used it to power a portion of its headquarters in Mountain View, California.) \"Those are the near-term catalysts that I'm looking for,\" Gupta said. Analysts in general expect Bloom to report an even stronger fourth quarter, ending 2025 with $1.9 billion in sales and forecasting $2.46 billion this year, but volatility is likely to remain part of the stock story. Indeed, Bloom shares have experienced 76 moves greater than 5% over the last year. Thursday and Friday's upturn exemplified the stock's rollercoaster ride, starkly contrasted against last year's low of $15.15 on April 9. Bloom's shares fell 17.3% in November, even as fundamentals remained strong. On December 4, shares spiked more than 13% intraday. Four days later, the stock fell 6.2%, while still being up 24% over the prior two weeks. In terms of competition, Bloom is considered the go-to for standalone power for data centers.  's hydrogen fuel cells are considerably more expensive to operate vs. LNG, so they are installed mostly as a backup source. Gupta dismissed   as a rival, saying it \"is probably 10 or maybe 15 years behind on technology from where Bloom was 10 years ago.\" Both of those stocks have seen significant losses in share price over the past year. Another 2025 stock boomer,  , has LNG turbines that are utilized as backup power sources at data centers, and an 80 GW backlog of orders, which will take the company into 2029 to fulfill, CEO Scott Strazik recently told investors. In the meantime, however, GE Vernova is developing fuel cell technology, different from Bloom's, that it expects to offer data centers in two to three years. Longer-term, industry watchers expect that   — large, traditional facilities and small modular reactors — as well as wind and solar sources, backed up by more efficient storage batteries, will be viable options for powering data centers. There's even talk of building solar-powered  . Those options are years away from being fully developed, though, making Bloom a right-now power solution for data center operators. \"They have a good first-mover advantage in gaining entrenchment, where they're going to see a huge spike in use,\" Krause said. For investors, especially after the run the stock has already been on, Bloom is a market bet that requires deep conviction. \"This is not a stock for the faint of heart,\" said Andrew Rocco, an analyst at Zacks Investment Research. It's going to be volatile, he said, but added, \"I expect these guys to grow high double digits or even triple digits over the next two to three years.\"",

At the kickoff of the National Retail Federation's   on Sunday, Google announced the launch of what it's calling the Universal Commerce Protocol. The company wants UCP to become an industry standard that retailers use for their AI agents and systems across tasks like discovery, buying and \"post-purchase-support.\" Google says the open-source protocol creates a unified system spanning the shopping experience, from searching to payment, so that retailers don't have to build their own tools and connect the various functions.  \"It's very important to have a standardized way so we can scale these things and everyone can be prepared for all the various steps to happen,\" Vidhya Srinivasan, vice president of Google ads and commerce, said in an interview. \"Businesses can pick and choose what they want so there's flexibility for them.\" E-commerce has emerged as one of the major battlegrounds in the booming generative AI market, with Google facing off against OpenAI, Perplexity and  , as they all try and get consumers to use their various apps and services to begin their shopping journey.  In September,  , which allows users to buy some products through ChatGPT, taking a fee from transactions it helps orchestrate. OpenAI's   developed in partnership with Stripe, is open source and could compete with UCP.  in May said it's partnering with   to let users buy products, book travel and secure concert tickets directly in its chat without leaving the platform, and in November said it will roll out   for U.S. users ahead of the holiday season.  And earlier last year, Amazon launched   a feature that lets consumers browse items from other brands' sites on Amazon. Some of those items include a button labeled   an AI agent that can   from other websites on a shopper's behalf. By 2030, the retail market could represent a $3 trillion to $5 trillion opportunity globally due to AI-powered tools and agentic commerce, according to a   in October from McKinsey.  Google said UCP was co-developed with companies including  ,  ,   and  . The protocol will soon power a new checkout feature allowing users to buy direct from Google's AI Mode or Gemini App. They can pay via Google Wallet, but Srinivasan said the company plans to include other payment methods like PayPal in the future.  Srinivasan said UCP will be compatible with other existing protocols.  As part of Sunday's announcements, Google also introduced a feature called Business Agent, allowing shoppers to chat with brands. \"This is to address the newer consumer behavior which is shifted toward more conversational commerce,\" Srinivasan said. \"We want retailers to be able to connect to users on our surfaces but using their own voice.\" Then there's Google's core market: advertising.  Google said it's testing \"Direct Offers,\" which will let retailers promote unique discounts, such as 20% off of a product, if a user of the AI Mode chatbot expresses intent to buy something.  \"Our role in the ecosystem is that of a matchmaker and one way is with ads,\" Srinivasan said. \"It's a really big focus for us to innovate in the space that adds value to both retailers and buyers.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article  and   said Sunday that shoppers will soon be able to use Google's artificial intelligence assistant Gemini to more easily discover and buy products from the retail giant and its warehouse club, Sam's Club. Incoming Walmart CEO John Furner and Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the companies have teamed up on stage at the National Retail Federation's Big Show, an annual industry conference held at New York City's Javits Center.  The CEOs did not say when the new feature will launch or share financial terms. The company said the experience will start first in the U.S. and then expand internationally. With the Google deal, Walmart is boosting its effort to keep up with customers who are using AI chatbots  . Walmart announced a deal with a rival to Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT, in October to   a feature that allows them to buy an item without leaving the AI chatbot. OpenAI recently launched that feature with Walmart and it has Instant Checkout deals with other retailers, including   and several   merchants like Skims, Vuori and Spanx. Walmart also has its own AI chatbot, a yellow smiley-faced assistant on its app called Sparky. \"The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,\" Furner said in a news release. \"We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it.\" In his remarks on stage, Furner, who will  , said Walmart is \"rewriting the retail playbook\" and, with AI, it's \"trying to close the gap between I want it and I have it.\" Pichai said that Google is excited to work with Walmart and described the adoption of AI as a \"transformative\" moment. For Walmart, the evolution of customers' shopping habits — such as searches that start in an AI chatbot rather than its own app or website — is reshaping the retailer's digital strategy. In a statement, David Guggina, Walmart U.S.'s chief ecommerce officer, said agentic AI \"helps us meet customers earlier in their shopping journey and in more places.\"  \"Over time, these agents will make it easier for customers to find what they need, want and love,\" he said. Walmart leaders have also been vocal about how AI will change the workforce and employees' roles, comments that carry additional weight as the company is the largest private employer in the U.S. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon,  , has spoken about the sweeping impact of the technology, saying that \"it's very clear that",

                "full_text": "In this article All computing devices require a part called memory, or RAM, for short-term data storage, but this year, there won't be enough of these essential components to meet worldwide demand. That's because companies like  ,   and   need so much RAM for their artificial intelligence chips, and those companies are the first ones in line for the components.  Three primary memory vendors —  , SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics — make up nearly the entire RAM market, and their businesses are benefitting from the surge in demand.  We have seen a very sharp, significant surge in demand for memory, and it has far outpaced our ability to supply that memory and, in our estimation, the supply capability of the whole memory industry,\" Micron business chief Sumit Sadana told CNBC this week at the CES trade show in Las Vegas.  Micron's stock is up 247% over the past year, and the company reported that net income   in the most recent quarter.   that it expects its December quarter operating profit to nearly triple as well. Meanwhile,   as its stock price in South Korea surges, and in October, the company said it had secured demand  .  Now, prices for memory are rising.  TrendForce, a Taipei-based researcher that closely covers the memory market, this week said it expects average DRAM memory prices to rise between 50% and 55% this quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2025. TrendForce analyst Tom Hsu told CNBC that type of increase for memory prices was \"unprecedented.\"  Chipmakers like Nvidia surround the part of the chip that does the computation — the graphics processing unit, or GPU — with several blocks of a fast, specialized component called high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, Sadana said. HBM is often visible when chipmakers hold up their new chips. Micron supplies memory to both Nvidia and AMD, the two leading GPU makers.  Nvidia's Rubin GPU, which recently entered production, comes with up to 288 gigabytes of next-generation HBM4 memory per chip. HBM is installed in eight visible blocks above and below the processor, and that GPU will be sold as part of single server rack called NVL72, which fittingly combines 72 of those GPUs into a single system. By comparison, smartphones typically come with 8 or 12GB of lower-powered DDR memory. But the HBM memory that AI chips need is much more demanding than the RAM used for consumers' laptops and smartphones. HBM is designed for high-bandwidth specifications required by AI chips, and it's produced in a complicated process where Micron stacks 12 to 16 layers of memory on a single chip, turning it into a \"cube.\" When Micron makes one bit of HBM memory, it has to forgo making three bits of more conventional memory for other devices. \"As we increase HBM supply, it leaves less memory left over for the non-HBM portion of the market, because of this three-to-one basis,\" Sadana said.  Hsu, the TrendForce analyst, said that memory makers are favoring server and HBM applications over other clients because there's higher potential for growth in demand in that business and cloud service providers are less price-sensitive.  In December, Micron said it would   a part of its business that aimed to provide memory for consumer PC builders so the company could save supply for AI chips and servers.  Some inside the tech industry are marveling at how much and how quickly the price of RAM for consumers has increased.  Dean Beeler, co-founder and tech chief at Juice Labs, said that a few months ago, he loaded up his computer with 256GB of RAM, the maximum amount that current consumer motherboards support. That cost him about $300 at the time.  \"Who knew that would end up being ~$3,000 of RAM just a few months later,\" he posted on Facebook on Monday. AI researchers started to see memory as a bottleneck just before   ChatGPT hit the market in late 2022, said Majestic Labs co-founder Sha Rabii, an entrepreneur who previously worked on silicon at Google and  . Prior AI systems were designed for models like convolutional neural networks, which require less memory than large language models, or LLMs, that are popular today, Rabii said.   While AI chips themselves have been getting much faster, memory has not, he said, which leads to powerful GPUs waiting around to get the data needed to run LLMs.  \"Your performance is limited by the amount of memory and the speed of the memory that you have, and if you keep adding more GPUs, it's not a win,\" Rabii said.  The AI industry refers to this as the \"memory wall.\"  \"The processor spends more time just twiddling its thumbs, waiting for data,\" Micron's Sadana said. More and faster memory means that AI systems can run bigger models, serve more customers simultaneously and add \"context windows\" that allow chatbots and other LLMs to remember previous conversations with users, which adds a touch of personalization to the experience.  Majestic Labs is   an AI system for inference with 128 terabytes of memory, or about 100 times more memory than some current AI systems, Rabii said, adding that the company plans to eschew HBM memory for lower-cost options. Rabii said the additional RAM and architecture support in the design will enable its computers to support significantly more users at the same time than other AI servers while using less power. Wall Street has been asking companies in the consumer electronics business, like   and  , how they will handle the memory shortage and if they might be forced to raise prices or cut margins. These days, memory accounts for about 20% of the hardware costs of a laptop, Hsu said. That's up from between 10% and 18% in the first half of 2025.  In October, Apple finance chief Kevan Parekh told analysts that his company was seeing a \"slight tailwind\" on memory prices but he downplayed it as \"nothing really to note there.\" But in November, Dell said it expected its cost basis for all of its products to go up as a result of the memory shortage. COO Jefferey Clarke told analysts that Dell planned to change its mix of configurations to minimize the price impacts, but he said the shortage will likely affect retail prices for devices.  \"I don't see how this will not make its way into the customer base,\" Clarke said. \"We'll do everything we can to mitigate that.\" Even Nvidia, which has emerged as the biggest customer in the HBM market, is facing questions about its ravenous memory needs — in particular, about its consumer products. At a press conference Tuesday at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was asked if he was concerned that the company's gaming customers might be resentful of AI technology because of rising game console and graphics cards prices that are being driven by the memory shortage.  Huang said Nvidia is a very large customer of memory and has long relationships with the companies in the space but that, ultimately, there would need to be more memory factories because the needs of AI are so high. \"Because our demand is so high, every factory, every HBM supplier, is gearing up, and they're all doing great,\" Huang said.  At most, Micron can only meet two-thirds of the medium-term memory requirements for some customers, Sadana said. But the company is currently building two big factories called fabs in Boise, Idaho, that will start producing memory in 2027 and 2028, he said. Micron is also going to break ground on a fab in the town of Clay, New York, that he said is expect to come online in 2030. But for now, \"we're sold out for 2026,\" Sadana said.",

Ron Wyden of Oregon, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico said the tech giants should, \"immediately remove the X and Grok apps from their app stores until the company's Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk, addresses these disturbing and likely illegal activities.\" \"Turning a blind eye to X's egregious behavior would make a mockery of your moderation practices,\" they wrote, adding that a failure to take action would \"undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones.\" Musk's xAI, the developer of Grok and parent of social media platform X, responded to CNBC's request for comment with an automated reply. Google and Apple didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.  Grok and X have been letting users easily generate and widely share \"deepfake\" explicit, sexualized content that includes people who never gave permission for their images to be used in such manner. Grok has also been used to generate images that denigrate people on the basis of their race or ethnicity. In one recent example, as The Times of London  , \"A descendant of Holocaust survivors was 'digitally stripped'\" by Grok after users prompted the AI tool to generate an image of her in a bikini standing outside of Auschwitz.  The issues have sparked widespread criticism and regulatory probes by foreign governments in Europe, Malaysia, Australia and India. However, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice have yet to say whether they will investigate xAI. On  , Musk and X issued statements saying that \"anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\"  Apple and Google both have stringent guidelines for app developers that would require them to prevent the uploading and sharing of images depicting child sexual abuse, and other explicit or harmful content.  Social media and messaging apps including   and   have been previously suspended by the Apple app store for failures to filter a variety of inappropriate content.

European industrial and manufacturing giants, including  ,  ,   and  , have all announced robotics projects and partnerships with robotics tech companies in the past year.

CEO Elon Musk said 80% of the company's value would come from its   in September,   AI division DeepMind released AI models for robotics in 2025, and Nvidia announced partnerships with Alphabet to work on physical AI in March. Tech investors have taken note. Companies building robotics raised a record $26.5 billion in 2025, according to deal counting platform Dealroom. To take advantage of the opportunity in AI, Europe has to \"get serious\" about its energy supply so that it can invest in the infrastructure layer, Huang said.  The region has some of the highest energy costs in the world. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said energy costs will be a key factor in determining how successful countries are in the   at WEF on Tuesday. \"I think that it's fairly certain that you have to get serious about increasing your energy supply so that you could invest in the infrastructure layer, so that you could have a rich ecosystem of artificial intelligence here in Europe,\" Huang said. Europe has been grappling with   as hyperscalers look to roll out AI infrastructure across the region.  That rapid buildout is showing no signs of slowing down, said Huang. AI has started the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" he told the audience at WEF. \"We're now a few hundred billion dollars into it.

Hassett had been   to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May, but prediction markets showed former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh moved ahead in the race following the president's remarks. Traders see Hassett as the more market-friendly option to replace Powell, with Wall Street expecting him to be more willing than Warsh to keep rates low. \"Whether it's Hassett or someone else, I think the assumption that we — at least most of us — have is that whoever it's going to be, this person is going to certainly have a political motive and not the more traditional, trying-to-be-fully-objective mindset in regards to leading the Fed,\" said David Krakauer, vice president of portfolio management at Mercer Advisors. \"That threat to the independence of the Fed is certainly, you know, a concern for us and everyone.\" The major averages are coming off a winning session thanks to gains in chip stocks.   led the advance after a blowout fourth-quarter report.

Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer   appears to have an edge against peer automakers in China, according to Macquarie Equity Research. Analyst Eugene Hsiao upgraded Nio to outperform from neutral in a Friday note to clients, citing the company's Battery-as-a-Service as a key differentiator, with more than 80% of customers opting to lease the battery rather than purchase it outright. This model means rising lithium costs could have a lower direct impact on margins for Nio, Hsiao said.  \"Volumes remain challenging, but we think NIO is at a point where high upfront spending on battery swapping and service centers provides an edge. A unique BaaS offering provides a strong alternative to traditional EV ownership; rising Onvo sales could provide a lifeline,\" the analyst wrote. Jefferies reiterated its buy rating on   in a Thursday note and raised its price target to $275 from $250. Shares of Nvidia have climbed 40% over the past 12 months. Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis' revised price forecast implies that the stock could surge another 47% from here. Curtis applauded Nvidia's Blackwell chip and Rubin chip platform as tailwinds for the company. \"Industry checks suggest further upside with beats continuing as Blackwell ramps,\" he wrote. \"See increased systems sales with the ramp of the Rubin, further increasing the competitive moat.\" In the analyst's base case, he sees Nvidia remaining the dominant supplier of acceleration solutions for data centers, while its gaming total addressable market expands at a double-digit compound annual growth rate. Benchmark moved off the sidelines on   on Friday ahead of what could be its first positive same-store sales quarter in years. Analyst Mike Hickey upgraded shares of the family entertainment chain's stock to buy from hold. Hickey set a $30 price target, implying a 55.3% increase over Thursday's closing level. Dave & Buster's could see same-store sales growth for the first time in around 13 quarters, according to Hickey. The analyst said that the Dallas-based company has been improving its food and beverage execution and seeing more traffic from a half-price promotion that launched earlier this month. Small caps have been outperforming to an extent that hasn't been seen in more than a decade. The   is on track to post a better daily move than the   for an 11th straight session on Friday.

However, over a longer time horizon the firm still has an in-line rating on the stock. Shares of Dollar Tree have jumped 96% in the past year. Analyst Michael Montani's price forecast of $165, up from $125, implies an additional upside of 17% from here. Montani said that his conviction in Dollar Tree's ability to execute rose following an Orlando store tour and deep dive with CFO Steward Glendinning. \"We see Dollar Tree's multi-price point merchandising strategy as a way to drive newness and relevance in its assortment. A further comp driver is the rollout of enhanced store standards which should increase customer satisfaction, sustain share gain and enhance margin performance,\" the analyst wrote.

Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman on Friday indicated that there is room ahead for more interest rate cuts as the central bank should prioritize getting ahead of potential weakness in the labor market. Speaking at an economic forum in Foxborough,  Mass., the policymaker advocated a forward-looking approach based on \"informed\" forecasts rather than the solely data-dependent policy many of her fellow officials back. \"Absent a clear and sustained improvement in labor market conditions, we should remain ready to adjust policy to bring it closer to neutral,\" Bowman said. \"We should also avoid signaling that we will pause without identifying that conditions have changed. Doing so will indicate that we are not attentive or responsive to the recent and expected path of the labor market.\" The central bank official added that she sees inflation \"on a sustained trajectory\" to the Fed's 2% goal countered by \"growing labor market fragility\" that the Fed should head move to \"preemptively stabilize.\" Bowman is under consideration for to take over the chair position when Jerome Powell's term expires in May, though prediction markets rate her to be an extreme longshot. Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh on Friday vaulted to the front of the pack in the race for central bank chair following remarks from President Donald Trump, according to a closely watched prediction market. Traders on Kalshi pushed Warsh well ahead of the person seen as his closest competitor, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. In remarks delivered Friday morning, Trump, without explicitly stating his decision, said he'd prefer to keep Hassett in his position as top economic advisor. \"I see Kevin's in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You ⁠were fantastic on television today,\" Trump said during remarks in the White House. \"I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth.\"  .  is seeing strong demand for its oral obesity treatment in its first week of sales, sending the stock up more than 4% in trading on Friday. That brings the drugmaker's year-to-date gains to nearly 18%, marking a big turnaround in the stock's performance.  Shares remain down 27% over the past 12 months as Novo Nordisk lost some of its first-mover advantage to  , which markets rival weight loss drug Zepbound. Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said Novo's weight loss pill accounted for about 1.3% of all Wegovy prescriptions in its very first week of launch. Raffat said that demand, which came during a holiday week, bodes well for not only Novo Nordisk but also for Eli Lilly, which hopes to bring its own oral obesity drug to market in April.    Bank of America Securities downgraded   to underperform from neutral on Tuesday, saying it sees better opportunities elsewhere. ConocoPhillips's oil breakeven is $53 U.S. West Texas Intermediate, which is materially higher than other oil and gas names, analyst Kalei Akamine said in a note to clients. An oil breakeven price is essentially the minimum price a company needs to cover its costs. In addition, the company's debt-adjusted free cash flow yield is an uncompetitive 4.4%, he said.  \"These headwinds are being driven in part by long-cycle spending on Port Arthur LNG and Willow, with start-up still two and four years away, respectively,\" Akamine wrote. \"At our forecast of $57 WTI, we do not believe COP can sustain its recent pace of returning 45% of cash flow.\" At the same time, Akamine upgraded   to buy on the strength of its oil breakeven price of $37. He also said there is \"the potential for a stronger‑than‑expected oil guide driven by what we view as solid operating momentum exiting 4Q25.\" Akamine raised his price target to $28 from $26, implying 24.5%  upside from Thursday's close. Despite the early gains at the index level, the number of declining stocks was greater than those advancing.

Bank of America has maintained its buy rating on  , despite the airline issuing more conservative guidance earlier this week.  On Tuesday, the airline revised its earnings guidance to $6.50-$7.50 per share for 2026, or below the Street's consensus estimate of about $7.30, according to a Bank of America note to clients dated Friday.  However, analysts shook off the downward revision following a call with investors and Delta CFO Dan Janki this week. They stressed that the firm's strong cash generation and focus on premium travel are reasons to remain bullish on the stock.  \"The call reinforced our thesis that DAL is a key structural leader in the airline industry given its premium revenue focus, strong cash generation, low leverage, and diversified revenue streams (loyalty, MRO),\" analyst Andrew Didora said in the note.  He added that Delta \"remains positive on fundamentals,\" as its customers, particularly clients that opt for its premium services, prove resilient to rising macroeconomic volatility.  Here are some of the stocks moving before the bell:   — The biotech company rallied 22%, adding to a 30% rally in the previous session that was sparked by strong guidance for its bladder cancer drug Anktiva. ImmunityBio expects full-year revenue for the drug to jump 700%.  — Shares rose more than 3% after Deutsche Bank   to buy, saying most of the regulatory uncertainty has been priced in.  — The bank rose 3% after posting better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and promising guidance. PNC reported revenue of $5.96 billion versus an LSEG consensus estimate of $5.89 billion. Earnings of $4.88 per share also exceeded a forecast of $4.22 per share.

As U.S. competition has lagged, Waymo's planned 2026 expansions could lock in rider demand and loyalty in the U.S. To start, Waymo will offer its services within a 60-square-mile area that includes Miami's Design District, Wynwood, Brickell and Coral Gables neighborhoods, the  .

                "full_text": "In this article When   agreed to spend a reported $2 billion on   at the end of last year, the social media giant said it planned to take the startup's subscription AI agent offering and \"scale this service to many more businesses.\" But some existing Manus customers aren't thrilled with the deal and say they're now going elsewhere, the latest sign of skepticism toward Meta as it tries to compete with the likes of OpenAI,   and Anthropic in the booming artificial intelligence market.  Manus, a developer of general purpose AI agents, was founded in China in 2022 before relocating to Singapore. Last year, the company launched its first general AI agent, which can be customized to execute complex tasks such as market research, coding and data analysis.  Seth Dobrin, co-founder and CEO of Arya Labs, said Manus was his favorite agentic AI platform, but his company, which develops a type of so-called world models, is no longer using it under Meta's ownership. Dobrin told CNBC that while he had confidence in Manus' transparent terms of service, he doesn't have that level of trust in Meta and is \"legitimately sad that this has happened.\" \"I do not agree with a lot of Meta's practices around data and how they essentially weaponize people's personal data against them,\" said Dobrin, who helped launch Arya last year. \"I don't want to engage with a company who I don't feel comfortable with how they're going to use data.\" Meta, which gets almost all of its $200 billion in annualized revenue from ads,   on Dec. 29, that its purchase of Manus was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.  Manus said in a   on the day of the deal that it had reached millions of paying customers and a revenue run rate of more than $125 million. \"Our top priority is ensuring that this change won't be disruptive for our customers,\"  Manus said. \"We will continue to sell and operate our product subscription service through our app and website. The company will continue to operate from Singapore.\" Despite those assurances, Dobrin isn't alone in his concern. Karl Yeh, co-founder of consulting firm  , which advises startups on how to integrate AI tools, said he stopped using Manus at his company and has advised his clients to follow suit.  \"Will the data policies of Meta apply to Manus? I would assume it will eventually,\" Yeh told CNBC. \"That was the concern we had and why we stopped recommending it to our clients.\" \"We don't know where Manus is going to fit into Meta's AI road map,\" Yeh said. \"We're not sure if Manus is going to still remain a separate company even though they said it would.\" Yeh said he's moving to services from a startup called Genspark or somewhere else where there's more certainty because, \"In terms of Meta, we're just not sure.\" Meta didn't provide a comment beyond pointing to the blog post, which notes that, \"We're excited to welcome the Manus team and help improve the lives of billions of people and millions of businesses with their technology.\" Meta has opened its wallets to try and win in AI, most notably   more than $14 billion in June to hire Scale AI's Alexandr Wang and a handful of his top engineers and researchers and secure a stake in his startup. But unlike AI model leaders OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, Meta has yet to land on a   in the market, particularly when it comes to competing in the enterprise.  Meta's stock is down 17% since CEO   said on the last   in October that AI costs will keep growing. Analysts anticipate 2026 spending on AI could top $100 billion. Meta is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results next week.  Flo Crivello, CEO of a Manus competitor, Lindy, said his company initially saw a bump in users after news of Meta's acquisition.  \"We think there was sort of a halo effect from the announcement,\" Crivello said. \"It raised awareness about this category of software and people started researching it.\"  Crivello, who previously spent almost five years at   and worked on acquisitions, said he thinks Meta's rationale is less about bringing in enterprise customers, and more targeted at serving small businesses, which have long been crucial to Meta's ad revenue.  Crivello said Manus is \"focused on very small business owners like independent contractors,\" and said it could take a while for Meta to figure out where it takes Manus from here.  \"The way these companies think of these acquisitions, they're acquiring the company for a specific, strategic reason — they just don't know precisely what the integration might look like yet,\" Crivello said. \"They cut a check, it's a new thing they add to the chess board and then they figure it out. And sometimes it takes them years to figure out what to do.\" Outside of advertising, Meta has struggled in several areas where it's tried to crack the enterprise. The company   in 2024 that it was shuttering its Workplace communication and productivity platform, two years after   its Portal video calling device.  Last week, Meta said it's sunsetting its   virtual reality app, part of a broader   from VR, which had been Zuckerberg's big focus area before AI took off.  Navrina Singh, founder and CEO of governance startup Credo AI, says she doesn't see Fortune 500 companies embracing Meta's tools.  \"Among large enterprises — particularly in highly regulated sectors like health care and financial services — many AI deployments today are built on models from providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic,\" Singh said. Then they're typically run through cloud platforms operated by   or  , \"where trust, security, and accountability requirements are well-established and prioritized,\" she said. One area where Meta is finding success in the business world is WhatsApp, the messaging platform it acquired for $19 billion in 2014. WhatsApp for Business has become a popular way for companies to interact with customers. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore, has projected WhatsApp could generate $40 billion in revenue by 2030.  \"Business messaging remains a significant opportunity for us,\" Meta CFO Susan Li said on the company's last earnings call. \"We're also making good progress on our business AI efforts, where we've been focused on building a turnkey AI that helps businesses generate leads and drive sales.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article When   agreed to spend a reported $2 billion on   at the end of last year, the social media giant said it planned to take the startup's subscription AI agent offering and \"scale this service to many more businesses.\" But some existing Manus customers aren't thrilled with the deal and say they're now going elsewhere, the latest sign of skepticism toward Meta as it tries to compete with the likes of OpenAI,   and Anthropic in the booming artificial intelligence market.  Manus, a developer of general purpose AI agents, was founded in China in 2022 before relocating to Singapore. Last year, the company launched its first general AI agent, which can be customized to execute complex tasks such as market research, coding and data analysis.  Seth Dobrin, co-founder and CEO of Arya Labs, said Manus was his favorite agentic AI platform, but his company, which develops a type of so-called world models, is no longer using it under Meta's ownership. Dobrin told CNBC that while he had confidence in Manus' transparent terms of service, he doesn't have that level of trust in Meta and is \"legitimately sad that this has happened.\" \"I do not agree with a lot of Meta's practices around data and how they essentially weaponize people's personal data against them,\" said Dobrin, who helped launch Arya last year. \"I don't want to engage with a company who I don't feel comfortable with how they're going to use data.\" Meta, which gets almost all of its $200 billion in annualized revenue from ads,   on Dec. 29, that its purchase of Manus was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.  Manus said in a   on the day of the deal that it had reached millions of paying customers and a revenue run rate of more than $125 million. \"Our top priority is ensuring that this change won't be disruptive for our customers,\"  Manus said. \"We will continue to sell and operate our product subscription service through our app and website. The company will continue to operate from Singapore.\" Despite those assurances, Dobrin isn't alone in his concern. Karl Yeh, co-founder of consulting firm  , which advises startups on how to integrate AI tools, said he stopped using Manus at his company and has advised his clients to follow suit.  \"Will the data policies of Meta apply to Manus? I would assume it will eventually,\" Yeh told CNBC. \"That was the concern we had and why we stopped recommending it to our clients.\" \"We don't know where Manus is going to fit into Meta's AI road map,\" Yeh said. \"We're not sure if Manus is going to still remain a separate company even though they said it would.\" Yeh said he's moving to services from a startup called Genspark or somewhere else where there's more certainty because, \"In terms of Meta, we're just not sure.\" Meta didn't provide a comment beyond pointing to the blog post, which notes that, \"We're excited to welcome the Manus team and help improve the lives of billions of people and millions of businesses with their technology.\" Meta has opened its wallets to try and win in AI, most notably   more than $14 billion in June to hire Scale AI's Alexandr Wang and a handful of his top engineers and researchers and secure a stake in his startup. But unlike AI model leaders OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, Meta has yet to land on a   in the market, particularly when it comes to competing in the enterprise.  Meta's stock is down 17% since CEO   said on the last   in October that AI costs will keep growing. Analysts anticipate 2026 spending on AI could top $100 billion. Meta is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results next week.  Flo Crivello, CEO of a Manus competitor, Lindy, said his company initially saw a bump in users after news of Meta's acquisition.  \"We think there was sort of a halo effect from the announcement,\" Crivello said. \"It raised awareness about this category of software and people started researching it.\"  Crivello, who previously spent almost five years at   and worked on acquisitions, said he thinks Meta's rationale is less about bringing in enterprise customers, and more targeted at serving small businesses, which have long been crucial to Meta's ad revenue.  Crivello said Manus is \"focused on very small business owners like independent contractors,\" and said it could take a while for Meta to figure out where it takes Manus from here.  \"The way these companies think of these acquisitions, they're acquiring the company for a specific, strategic reason — they just don't know precisely what the integration might look like yet,\" Crivello said. \"They cut a check, it's a new thing they add to the chess board and then they figure it out. And sometimes it takes them years to figure out what to do.\" Outside of advertising, Meta has struggled in several areas where it's tried to crack the enterprise. The company   in 2024 that it was shuttering its Workplace communication and productivity platform, two years after   its Portal video calling device.  Last week, Meta said it's sunsetting its   virtual reality app, part of a broader   from VR, which had been Zuckerberg's big focus area before AI took off.  Navrina Singh, founder and CEO of governance startup Credo AI, says she doesn't see Fortune 500 companies embracing Meta's tools.  \"Among large enterprises — particularly in highly regulated sectors like health care and financial services — many AI deployments today are built on models from providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic,\" Singh said. Then they're typically run through cloud platforms operated by   or  , \"where trust, security, and accountability requirements are well-established and prioritized,\" she said. One area where Meta is finding success in the business world is WhatsApp, the messaging platform it acquired for $19 billion in 2014. WhatsApp for Business has become a popular way for companies to interact with customers. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore, has projected WhatsApp could generate $40 billion in revenue by 2030.  \"Business messaging remains a significant opportunity for us,\" Meta CFO Susan Li said on the company's last earnings call. \"We're also making good progress on our business AI efforts, where we've been focused on building a turnkey AI that helps businesses generate leads and drive sales.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said reducing \"AI slop\" and detecting deepfakes are priorities for the  -owned video site in 2026.  \"It's becoming harder to detect what's real and what's AI-generated,\" Mohan wrote in his annual letter published Wednesday. \"This is particularly critical when it comes to deepfakes.\"  With artificial intelligence penetrating every aspect of technology, Google has been investing heavily in building out the   to support new and growing workloads while also bolstering its Gemini models and adding AI features to its portfolio of business and consumer products.  But as one of the leading sources of user-generated content on the internet, YouTube is dealing with an explosion in the number of videos created by AI. The term AI slop   to the mass of low-quality AI content that's showing up across social media platforms. In addition to YouTube, companies such as   and TikTok rely on recommendation systems powered by AI that surface personalized videos designed to keep users engaged for longer periods of time. Mohan said the world is at an \"inflection point,\" where \"the lines between creativity and technology are blurring.\" \"To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we're actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content,\" Mohan wrote.  He said that YouTube clearly labels videos created by AI products and requires creators to disclose if they've produced altered content. The company's systems also remove \"harmful synthetic media\" that violates its guidelines, Mohan wrote.  Critical to YouTube's growth among users, creators and advertisers is keeping the platform desirable for all parties involved.  In December, YouTube said it would be   its \"likeness detection,\" which flags when a creator's face is used without their permission in deepfakes. The feature is being rolled out to millions of creators in the YouTube Partner Program. Mohan's letter said the company will use AI as a tool and \"not a replacement,\" adding that on average more than 1 million YouTube channels used its artificial intelligence creation technology daily in December. The company is expanding the way creators can take advantage of AI, he said, including on YouTube's short-form video offering called Shorts, which competes with TikTok and Instagram Reels.  \"This year you'll be able to create a Short using your own likeness, produce games with a simple text prompt, and experiment with music,\" he wrote.  Mohan described creators as \"the new stars and studios,\" and said YouTube creators are \"buying studio-sized lots in Hollywood and beyond to pioneer new formats and produce beautifully produced, must-see TV.\"  The company also wants to provide new ways for creators to earn, from \"shopping and brand deals to fan funding features like Jewels and gifts.\" Another priority, Mohan said, is making YouTube \"the best place for kids and teens\" and said this year the company plans to make it easier for parents to set up new kid accounts and to easily switch between them. YouTube   in September that it's paid out more than $100 billion to creators, artists and media companies since 2021. Earlier in the year, analysts at MoffettNathanson   that If it was a stand-alone business, YouTube would be worth between $475 billion and $550 billion.",

                "full_text": "In this article The future of the   company – its iconic movie studio, HBO Max, and its cable networks, including CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery and HGTV – may come down to what European regulators think about  . That's a pretty crazy twist for a deal that will dictate the future of many valuable American sports rights – assets that, for the most part, have very little to do with Europe. A quick refresher: WBD owns many live U.S. sports rights, including those to March Madness, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, the French Open, AEW, the College Football Playoffs and others. But those rights wouldn't go to Netflix under   to sell some of its assets to the streaming giant. Netflix has agreed to pay $27.75 per share for the WBD movie studio and streaming business, but not the cable networks, which own the sports rights. If the deal is approved, those networks would get spun out into a separate publicly traded entity called Discovery Global, which would also own Bleacher Report, House of Highlights and WBD's other digital assets. If WBD shareholders accept a   from  , however – and if that deal is approved – the cable networks and associated sports would all fall under the Paramount umbrella. Paramount has bid $30 per share for the entirety of WBD – an offer it has taken directly to shareholders after the WBD board rejected it. Paramount on Thursday   on its tender offer — which expired Wednesday — giving WBD shareholders more time to weigh the option.  WBD responded with a statement, noting that less than 7% of all shareholders have tendered their shares thus far to Paramount. \"Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. It's also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount's inferior scheme,\" WBD said. \"We are confident in our ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Netflix merger and look forward to delivering the tremendous and certain value our agreement will provide to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.\" Most media attention has focused on what U.S. President Donald Trump   a Netflix-WBD deal. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Trump ahead of the deal to gauge his sentiment on a transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice — theoretically an independent body from the presidency – will ultimately decide whether or not the deal presents antitrust problems, and if those issues can be ameliorated with conditions or if they're simply too big for a deal to go through. There's been far less attention paid to Europe, which will also need to approve a deal. And that's where either deal could fall apart.  Netflix is a global company, generating about $14.5 billion in revenue in its \"EMEA\" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region last year, or about 32% of total sales.  WBD feels confident its Netflix deal will win EU approval, according to people familiar with the matter. A WBD source said there was a \"95% certainty\" that Europe would approve the transaction, though the person did acknowledge Netflix may need to agree to certain conditions, such as agreeing to produce a certain amount of local content in Europe and promising to release movies into theaters. The EU's   already mandates that video-on-demand streaming services ensure at least 30% of programming in EU countries qualify as European works.  Paramount disagrees and believes a Netflix deal has very little chance of making it past European regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. At the same time, it's working its own EU regulatory angles for its proposed takeover. It would be unusual but not unprecedented for European regulators to block a deal between two U.S.-based companies.     $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma in December 2023 after deciding there was \"no clear path\" to gaining antitrust approval in Europe and the U.K. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority     Facebook to sell Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks, in 2022. The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. . It's also worth noting the European Commission allowed Amazon to acquire MGM, perhaps the closest comparison in terms of comparative businesses to this deal. Paramount's confidence stems from the continent's track record of being tough on tech companies, with antitrust crackdowns and penalties   Meta,  ,     and Amazon in recent years. Paramount executives believe EU regulators view Netflix similarly, based on recent conversations they've had with European officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Given the chance to stop a Big Tech company from gaining even more market power, Paramount executives believe Europe will take it. The EU may also be more parochial in how it treats movie theater owners, viewing them as essential to culture and art. Both U.S. and European trade associations for the cinema industry have   their   with a Netflix-Warner combination. This week, Sarandos reiterated that Warner Bros. films will be released in theaters with a 45-day window — as they always have. \"We're working closely with WBD and the regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals,\" Sarandos said Tuesday during   \"When this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled, world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. And we're excited to maintain it and further strengthen that business.\" The WBD board viewed two movie studios coming together – Paramount and Warner – as a bigger regulatory hurdle than any issue presented by Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, WBD's lawyers have determined both deals – Netflix-WBD and Paramount-WBD – would likely gain approval. \"The WBD Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the [Paramount tender] Offer with its regulatory advisors,\" WBD said in a December corporate filing. \"The WBD Board is of the view that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material.\" On the movie theater issue, a Warner source told me WBD actually views Paramount as a potentially bigger issue than Netflix. That's because WBD's board and executives aren't sure Paramount will have the money to produce 30 or more movies a year (a Paramount CEO David Ellison  ) while also paying down billions of dollars in debt and targeting $6 billion in cost savings.  This is why the structure of the Paramount deal is so important to WBD. To create a superior deal for WBD, Larry Ellison, David's father and one of the world's wealthiest men, would need to put up more money in equity to lower the leverage ratio of a combined company. The board doesn't trust Paramount can deliver on its synergies while also meeting its aggressive theatrical goals and moving forward with a leverage ratio over 7-times estimated 2026 EBITDA. This week, Netflix changed its offer for WBD's assets from mostly cash to  . Simplifying the bid allows WBD to move its shareholder meeting to approve the Netflix offer earlier – possibly as early as March, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount is still considering if it wants to raise its bid or change the capital structure to re-engage the WBD board, according to people familiar with the matter. It could also do nothing and wait to see if it's right about regulators – either European or American – blocking a Netflix deal. With so much attention on the importance of live sports to the TV industry, it's unusual to see them as such an afterthought. Paramount executives have argued the value of Discovery Global should be $0 based on its high leverage ratio and the early valuation of Versant, the parent company of CNBC, which has traded down almost 30% since it debuted on the public markets this month. In a   released Tuesday, WBD argued Discovery Global should be valued between $1.33 per share and $6.86 per share, depending on estimates.",

The EU has  in response to Trump announcing plans to impose 10% tariffs on six EU nations, alongside the U.K. and Norway from Feb. 1 on Saturday. There were calls for the bloc to consider using its anti-coercion instrument (ACI), a set of measures that allow it to impose sweeping trade sanctions, before Trump announced a   on Wednesday evening. \"All EU trade defense instruments — including the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI) — must now be reviewed,\" Volker Treier, chief executive of foreign trade at the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHK), which represents nearly 4 million businesses, told CNBC on Wednesday afternoon. He added that the ACI should be a \"last resort.\"  .  European stocks advanced on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump said a \"framework\" agreement had been reached over Greenland, and called off imposing escalating tariffs on a group of European countries. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was 1.13% higher shortly after the opening bell in London. GameStop CEO and chairman Ryan Cohen snapped up more of the video game retailer's shares, according to a Wednesday regulatory filing. The executive bought 500,000 shares at a weighted average price of $21.60 each on Wednesday, according   with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That's in addition to a purchase of 500,000 shares  . In this latest SEC filing, Cohen said it is \"essential\" for the CEO of a public company to purchase that company's shares with his or her own personal funds \"in order to strengthen alignment with stockholders.\" CEOs who fail to do so \"should be fired,\" the filing went on.

Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius Research, wrote in a note to clients that Intel's strong performance could signal more value ahead for its foundry business. \"Since Lip-Bu Tan was announced as CEO, shares of Intel have risen about 160%, with most of that performance coming since September when shortages started to become a big thing. Intel has the backing of Nvidia and the U.S. Government, who both look very smart right now. Intel is also now part of the vast 'shortage cohort' along with  ,   and other rocket ships ... Surging data center capex is driving up demand for Intel's server CPUs and advanced packaging assets for chips,\" Reitzes wrote. \"There is another issue reverberating throughout 'the shortage world,' specific to Intel but forgotten by haters. The more TSMC raises prices and is forced to give Nvidia and Broadcom huge AI chip allocations, the more an elephant like Apple will be forced to engage with Intel for its Foundry,\" he added Shares of   dropped 3.5% after the company issued disappointing first-quarter guidance. The truckload carrier sees first quarter adjusted earnings landing between 28 cents to 32 cents per share, compared to the FactSet consensus call for 31 cents a share. Fourth-quarter results also missed the mark on the top and bottom lines.

                "full_text": "In this article When   agreed to spend a reported $2 billion on   at the end of last year, the social media giant said it planned to take the startup's subscription AI agent offering and \"scale this service to many more businesses.\" But some existing Manus customers aren't thrilled with the deal and say they're now going elsewhere, the latest sign of skepticism toward Meta as it tries to compete with the likes of OpenAI,   and Anthropic in the booming artificial intelligence market.  Manus, a developer of general purpose AI agents, was founded in China in 2022 before relocating to Singapore. Last year, the company launched its first general AI agent, which can be customized to execute complex tasks such as market research, coding and data analysis.  Seth Dobrin, co-founder and CEO of Arya Labs, said Manus was his favorite agentic AI platform, but his company, which develops a type of so-called world models, is no longer using it under Meta's ownership. Dobrin told CNBC that while he had confidence in Manus' transparent terms of service, he doesn't have that level of trust in Meta and is \"legitimately sad that this has happened.\" \"I do not agree with a lot of Meta's practices around data and how they essentially weaponize people's personal data against them,\" said Dobrin, who helped launch Arya last year. \"I don't want to engage with a company who I don't feel comfortable with how they're going to use data.\" Meta, which gets almost all of its $200 billion in annualized revenue from ads,   on Dec. 29, that its purchase of Manus was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.  Manus said in a   on the day of the deal that it had reached millions of paying customers and a revenue run rate of more than $125 million. \"Our top priority is ensuring that this change won't be disruptive for our customers,\"  Manus said. \"We will continue to sell and operate our product subscription service through our app and website. The company will continue to operate from Singapore.\" Despite those assurances, Dobrin isn't alone in his concern. Karl Yeh, co-founder of consulting firm  , which advises startups on how to integrate AI tools, said he stopped using Manus at his company and has advised his clients to follow suit.  \"Will the data policies of Meta apply to Manus? I would assume it will eventually,\" Yeh told CNBC. \"That was the concern we had and why we stopped recommending it to our clients.\" \"We don't know where Manus is going to fit into Meta's AI road map,\" Yeh said. \"We're not sure if Manus is going to still remain a separate company even though they said it would.\" Yeh said he's moving to services from a startup called Genspark or somewhere else where there's more certainty because, \"In terms of Meta, we're just not sure.\" Meta didn't provide a comment beyond pointing to the blog post, which notes that, \"We're excited to welcome the Manus team and help improve the lives of billions of people and millions of businesses with their technology.\" Meta has opened its wallets to try and win in AI, most notably   more than $14 billion in June to hire Scale AI's Alexandr Wang and a handful of his top engineers and researchers and secure a stake in his startup. But unlike AI model leaders OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, Meta has yet to land on a   in the market, particularly when it comes to competing in the enterprise.  Meta's stock is down 17% since CEO   said on the last   in October that AI costs will keep growing. Analysts anticipate 2026 spending on AI could top $100 billion. Meta is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results next week.  Flo Crivello, CEO of a Manus competitor, Lindy, said his company initially saw a bump in users after news of Meta's acquisition.  \"We think there was sort of a halo effect from the announcement,\" Crivello said. \"It raised awareness about this category of software and people started researching it.\"  Crivello, who previously spent almost five years at   and worked on acquisitions, said he thinks Meta's rationale is less about bringing in enterprise customers, and more targeted at serving small businesses, which have long been crucial to Meta's ad revenue.  Crivello said Manus is \"focused on very small business owners like independent contractors,\" and said it could take a while for Meta to figure out where it takes Manus from here.  \"The way these companies think of these acquisitions, they're acquiring the company for a specific, strategic reason — they just don't know precisely what the integration might look like yet,\" Crivello said. \"They cut a check, it's a new thing they add to the chess board and then they figure it out. And sometimes it takes them years to figure out what to do.\" Outside of advertising, Meta has struggled in several areas where it's tried to crack the enterprise. The company   in 2024 that it was shuttering its Workplace communication and productivity platform, two years after   its Portal video calling device.  Last week, Meta said it's sunsetting its   virtual reality app, part of a broader   from VR, which had been Zuckerberg's big focus area before AI took off.  Navrina Singh, founder and CEO of governance startup Credo AI, says she doesn't see Fortune 500 companies embracing Meta's tools.  \"Among large enterprises — particularly in highly regulated sectors like health care and financial services — many AI deployments today are built on models from providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic,\" Singh said. Then they're typically run through cloud platforms operated by   or  , \"where trust, security, and accountability requirements are well-established and prioritized,\" she said. One area where Meta is finding success in the business world is WhatsApp, the messaging platform it acquired for $19 billion in 2014. WhatsApp for Business has become a popular way for companies to interact with customers. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore, has projected WhatsApp could generate $40 billion in revenue by 2030.  \"Business messaging remains a significant opportunity for us,\" Meta CFO Susan Li said on the company's last earnings call. \"We're also making good progress on our business AI efforts, where we've been focused on building a turnkey AI that helps businesses generate leads and drive sales.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article The future of the   company – its iconic movie studio, HBO Max, and its cable networks, including CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery and HGTV – may come down to what European regulators think about  . That's a pretty crazy twist for a deal that will dictate the future of many valuable American sports rights – assets that, for the most part, have very little to do with Europe. A quick refresher: WBD owns many live U.S. sports rights, including those to March Madness, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, the French Open, AEW, the College Football Playoffs and others. But those rights wouldn't go to Netflix under   to sell some of its assets to the streaming giant. Netflix has agreed to pay $27.75 per share for the WBD movie studio and streaming business, but not the cable networks, which own the sports rights. If the deal is approved, those networks would get spun out into a separate publicly traded entity called Discovery Global, which would also own Bleacher Report, House of Highlights and WBD's other digital assets. If WBD shareholders accept a   from  , however – and if that deal is approved – the cable networks and associated sports would all fall under the Paramount umbrella. Paramount has bid $30 per share for the entirety of WBD – an offer it has taken directly to shareholders after the WBD board rejected it. Paramount on Thursday   on its tender offer — which expired Wednesday — giving WBD shareholders more time to weigh the option.  WBD responded with a statement, noting that less than 7% of all shareholders have tendered their shares thus far to Paramount. \"Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. It's also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount's inferior scheme,\" WBD said. \"We are confident in our ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Netflix merger and look forward to delivering the tremendous and certain value our agreement will provide to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.\" Most media attention has focused on what U.S. President Donald Trump   a Netflix-WBD deal. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Trump ahead of the deal to gauge his sentiment on a transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice — theoretically an independent body from the presidency – will ultimately decide whether or not the deal presents antitrust problems, and if those issues can be ameliorated with conditions or if they're simply too big for a deal to go through. There's been far less attention paid to Europe, which will also need to approve a deal. And that's where either deal could fall apart.  Netflix is a global company, generating about $14.5 billion in revenue in its \"EMEA\" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region last year, or about 32% of total sales.  WBD feels confident its Netflix deal will win EU approval, according to people familiar with the matter. A WBD source said there was a \"95% certainty\" that Europe would approve the transaction, though the person did acknowledge Netflix may need to agree to certain conditions, such as agreeing to produce a certain amount of local content in Europe and promising to release movies into theaters. The EU's   already mandates that video-on-demand streaming services ensure at least 30% of programming in EU countries qualify as European works.  Paramount disagrees and believes a Netflix deal has very little chance of making it past European regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. At the same time, it's working its own EU regulatory angles for its proposed takeover. It would be unusual but not unprecedented for European regulators to block a deal between two U.S.-based companies.     $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma in December 2023 after deciding there was \"no clear path\" to gaining antitrust approval in Europe and the U.K. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority     Facebook to sell Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks, in 2022. The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. . It's also worth noting the European Commission allowed Amazon to acquire MGM, perhaps the closest comparison in terms of comparative businesses to this deal. Paramount's confidence stems from the continent's track record of being tough on tech companies, with antitrust crackdowns and penalties   Meta,  ,     and Amazon in recent years. Paramount executives believe EU regulators view Netflix similarly, based on recent conversations they've had with European officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Given the chance to stop a Big Tech company from gaining even more market power, Paramount executives believe Europe will take it. The EU may also be more parochial in how it treats movie theater owners, viewing them as essential to culture and art. Both U.S. and European trade associations for the cinema industry have   their   with a Netflix-Warner combination. This week, Sarandos reiterated that Warner Bros. films will be released in theaters with a 45-day window — as they always have. \"We're working closely with WBD and the regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals,\" Sarandos said Tuesday during   \"When this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled, world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. And we're excited to maintain it and further strengthen that business.\" The WBD board viewed two movie studios coming together – Paramount and Warner – as a bigger regulatory hurdle than any issue presented by Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, WBD's lawyers have determined both deals – Netflix-WBD and Paramount-WBD – would likely gain approval. \"The WBD Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the [Paramount tender] Offer with its regulatory advisors,\" WBD said in a December corporate filing. \"The WBD Board is of the view that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material.\" On the movie theater issue, a Warner source told me WBD actually views Paramount as a potentially bigger issue than Netflix. That's because WBD's board and executives aren't sure Paramount will have the money to produce 30 or more movies a year (a Paramount CEO David Ellison  ) while also paying down billions of dollars in debt and targeting $6 billion in cost savings.  This is why the structure of the Paramount deal is so important to WBD. To create a superior deal for WBD, Larry Ellison, David's father and one of the world's wealthiest men, would need to put up more money in equity to lower the leverage ratio of a combined company. The board doesn't trust Paramount can deliver on its synergies while also meeting its aggressive theatrical goals and moving forward with a leverage ratio over 7-times estimated 2026 EBITDA. This week, Netflix changed its offer for WBD's assets from mostly cash to  . Simplifying the bid allows WBD to move its shareholder meeting to approve the Netflix offer earlier – possibly as early as March, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount is still considering if it wants to raise its bid or change the capital structure to re-engage the WBD board, according to people familiar with the matter. It could also do nothing and wait to see if it's right about regulators – either European or American – blocking a Netflix deal. With so much attention on the importance of live sports to the TV industry, it's unusual to see them as such an afterthought. Paramount executives have argued the value of Discovery Global should be $0 based on its high leverage ratio and the early valuation of Versant, the parent company of CNBC, which has traded down almost 30% since it debuted on the public markets this month. In a   released Tuesday, WBD argued Discovery Global should be valued between $1.33 per share and $6.86 per share, depending on estimates.",

A quick refresher: WBD owns many live U.S. sports rights, including those to March Madness, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, the French Open, AEW, the College Football Playoffs and others. But those rights wouldn't go to Netflix under   to sell some of its assets to the streaming giant. Netflix has agreed to pay $27.75 per share for the WBD movie studio and streaming business, but not the cable networks, which own the sports rights. If the deal is approved, those networks would get spun out into a separate publicly traded entity called Discovery Global, which would also own Bleacher Report, House of Highlights and WBD's other digital assets. If WBD shareholders accept a   from  , however – and if that deal is approved – the cable networks and associated sports would all fall under the Paramount umbrella. Paramount has bid $30 per share for the entirety of WBD – an offer it has taken directly to shareholders after the WBD board rejected it. Paramount on Thursday   on its tender offer — which expired Wednesday — giving WBD shareholders more time to weigh the option.  WBD responded with a statement, noting that less than 7% of all shareholders have tendered their shares thus far to Paramount. \"Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. It's also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount's inferior scheme,\" WBD said. \"We are confident in our ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Netflix merger and look forward to delivering the tremendous and certain value our agreement will provide to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.\" Most media attention has focused on what U.S. President Donald Trump   a Netflix-WBD deal. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Trump ahead of the deal to gauge his sentiment on a transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice — theoretically an independent body from the presidency – will ultimately decide whether or not the deal presents antitrust problems, and if those issues can be ameliorated with conditions or if they're simply too big for a deal to go through. There's been far less attention paid to Europe, which will also need to approve a deal. And that's where either deal could fall apart.  Netflix is a global company, generating about $14.5 billion in revenue in its \"EMEA\" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region last year, or about 32% of total sales.  WBD feels confident its Netflix deal will win EU approval, according to people familiar with the matter. A WBD source said there was a \"95% certainty\" that Europe would approve the transaction, though the person did acknowledge Netflix may need to agree to certain conditions, such as agreeing to produce a certain amount of local content in Europe and promising to release movies into theaters. The EU's   already mandates that video-on-demand streaming services ensure at least 30% of programming in EU countries qualify as European works.  Paramount disagrees and believes a Netflix deal has very little chance of making it past European regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. At the same time, it's working its own EU regulatory angles for its proposed takeover. It would be unusual but not unprecedented for European regulators to block a deal between two U.S.-based companies.     $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma in December 2023 after deciding there was \"no clear path\" to gaining antitrust approval in Europe and the U.K. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority     Facebook to sell Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks, in 2022. The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. . It's also worth noting the European Commission allowed Amazon to acquire MGM, perhaps the closest comparison in terms of comparative businesses to this deal. Paramount's confidence stems from the continent's track record of being tough on tech companies, with antitrust crackdowns and penalties   Meta,  ,     and Amazon in recent years. Paramount executives believe EU regulators view Netflix similarly, based on recent conversations they've had with European officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Given the chance to stop a Big Tech company from gaining even more market power, Paramount executives believe Europe will take it. The EU may also be more parochial in how it treats movie theater owners, viewing them as essential to culture and art. Both U.S. and European trade associations for the cinema industry have   their   with a Netflix-Warner combination. This week, Sarandos reiterated that Warner Bros. films will be released in theaters with a 45-day window — as they always have. \"We're working closely with WBD and the regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals,\" Sarandos said Tuesday during   \"When this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled, world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. And we're excited to maintain it and further strengthen that business.\" The WBD board viewed two movie studios coming together – Paramount and Warner – as a bigger regulatory hurdle than any issue presented by Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, WBD's lawyers have determined both deals – Netflix-WBD and Paramount-WBD – would likely gain approval. \"The WBD Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the [Paramount tender] Offer with its regulatory advisors,\" WBD said in a December corporate filing. \"The WBD Board is of the view that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material.\" On the movie theater issue, a Warner source told me WBD actually views Paramount as a potentially bigger issue than Netflix. That's because WBD's board and executives aren't sure Paramount will have the money to produce 30 or more movies a year (a Paramount CEO David Ellison  ) while also paying down billions of dollars in debt and targeting $6 billion in cost savings.  This is why the structure of the Paramount deal is so important to WBD. To create a superior deal for WBD, Larry Ellison, David's father and one of the world's wealthiest men, would need to put up more money in equity to lower the leverage ratio of a combined company. The board doesn't trust Paramount can deliver on its synergies while also meeting its aggressive theatrical goals and moving forward with a leverage ratio over 7-times estimated 2026 EBITDA. This week, Netflix changed its offer for WBD's assets from mostly cash to  . Simplifying the bid allows WBD to move its shareholder meeting to approve the Netflix offer earlier – possibly as early as March, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount is still considering if it wants to raise its bid or change the capital structure to re-engage the WBD board, according to people familiar with the matter. It could also do nothing and wait to see if it's right about regulators – either European or American – blocking a Netflix deal. With so much attention on the importance of live sports to the TV industry, it's unusual to see them as such an afterthought. Paramount executives have argued the value of Discovery Global should be $0 based on its high leverage ratio and the early valuation of Versant, the parent company of CNBC, which has traded down almost 30% since it debuted on the public markets this month. In a   released Tuesday, WBD argued Discovery Global should be valued between $1.33 per share and $6.86 per share, depending on estimates.",

                "full_text": "In this article  on Wednesday rolled out an     assistant for members of its primary care chain One Medical, joining the likes of   and  , which recently launched similar features. The tool, called Health AI, uses large language models from Amazon's Bedrock service to answer questions and provide members with personalized advice based on their medical records, lab results and current medications.  It can also assist with managing medications and book appointments with a user's One Medical provider.  The tool pulls answers from a variety of sources, including licensed and proprietary data, knowledge verified by medical experts and in some cases, publicly-available data, Amazon said. Health AI appears in the app for One Medical, the health-care company Amazon acquired for   in 2023. One Medical runs brick-and-mortar clinics and also offers some telehealth services to members who pay between $99 and $199 a year for its services. Amazon said Health AI isn't intended to provide diagnosis or treatment, and it shouldn't replace a doctor's visit. The tool is \"programmed with clinical protocols\" that identify when symptoms or conditions require escalation to a provider or for an in-person visit, the company said. Conversations with Health AI also aren't added to a patient's medical records, Amazon said.  The company   Health AI among a subset of One Medical members last Spring before rolling out the tool more broadly. Other AI providers have also jumped into the lucrative health-care market.  Earlier this month, OpenAI launched  , a feature within its chatbot that enables users to upload medical records and receive personalized advice. Anthropic released its   feature shortly after.  Amazon said Health AI is easier for patients to use because it doesn't require them to upload documents or connect outside apps, and it's \"more actionable\" compared to other offerings. \"In short: other AI health chatbots provide general health information,\" Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, told CNBC in a statement. \"One Medical's Health AI assistant knows your health story, can take actions based on a patient's request, and keeps your trusted providers in the lead. It's the difference between getting answers and getting care.\" Amazon has   into health-care over the past decade. In addition to acquiring One Medical, Amazon also bought online pharmacy PillPack for about $750 million in 2018. Two years later, it launched its own offering called  . The company said Health AI may direct users to One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy services \"where it is helpful,\" but protected health information isn't used to market or advertise general merchandise from its broader webstore.",

                "full_text": "In this article China's technology giants are entering a new phase of the artificial intelligence race called 'agentic commerce,' as firms such as Alibaba and ByteDance race to turn chatbots into full-service shopping and payment tools. Alibaba last week  , allowing users to complete transactions directly within the interface, including ordering food and booking air tickets. The upgrade connects Qwen to Alibaba's broader e-commerce ecosystem, allowing users to compare tailored product recommendations from platforms such as Taobao or its travel site Fliggy, before finally completing payments through Alipay, all without leaving the chatbot. Previously, Qwen could make recommendations based on user-generated prompts, but users still had to manually navigate multiple platforms to make purchases. The update reflects a broader shift among some global artificial intelligence firms from a focus on foundational AI models to \"agentic AI\", which performs tasks on behalf of users with limited supervision. \"The agentic transformation of commercial services enables the maximal integration of user services [and] enhances user stickiness,\" said Shaochen Wang, a research analyst at Counterpoint Research, referring to stronger long-term user engagement. That allows companies to build a sustainable competitive advantage, often called a business moat, which helps protect profits from competitors, he added. While commercial applications for agentic AI are expected to range from autonomous driving to cybersecurity, e-commerce is emerging as one of its earliest and most pervasive use cases, with payment and tech giants in the U.S. also   in recent months. Within China, Alibaba is well-positioned to be a pioneer in agentic commerce due to its advanced large language model capabilities and its extensive e-commerce network covering clothing, food, housing, and transportation, Wang said. Alibaba's strategy could help it compete with rival super apps such as Tencent's WeChat — widely regarded as China's leading 'super app' — which combines messaging, payments, e-commerce and other services into a single platform used by over 1 billion users. Other Chinese firms are also moving quickly.  ByteDance in December upgraded its popular Doubao AI chatbot to autonomously handle tasks such as ticket bookings through integrations with e-commerce features on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. The upgraded Doubao model was introduced on a prototype smartphone developed by ZTE Corp  capable of performing tasks across a user's mobile device. However,   were later   after rivals raised privacy and security concerns. Meanwhile, Tencent President Martin Lau said during the company's   that AI agents could become core components of the WeChat ecosystem.  \"AI agents will be foundational to the evolution of super apps, with success depending on deep integration across payments, logistics, and social engagement,\" Charlie Dai, VP and principal analyst at Forrester, told CNBC. While Chinese firms like  ,   and ByteDance will compete to embed agents across their platforms, they all benefit from integrated ecosystems, rich behavioral data, and consumer familiarity with super apps, said Dai. Western companies, while leading in foundational AI models and global reach, face more fragmented data and stricter privacy regulations, slowing cross-service integration, he added. U.S. players pursuing agentic commerce include OpenAI, Perplexity, and  .   is also exploring ways to position itself as a \" \" between merchants, consumers and AI agents. \"China will prioritize domestic integration and strategic expansion in selected regions, while U.S. firms focus on global scalability and governance,\" Dai noted. Approximately half of all consumers already use AI when searching online, according to a  .  The report estimated that AI agents could generate more than $1 trillion in economic value for U.S. businesses by 2030 by streamlining important yet routine steps in consumer decision-making.",

Huang, one of the foremost voices on artificial intelligence, struck an optimistic tone on its impact on the labor market in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos Wednesday.  \"This is the largest infrastructure build-out in human history that's going to create a lot of jobs,\" Huang said. \"It's wonderful that the jobs are related to trade craft, and we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steel workers, and network technicians, and people who install and fit out the equipment.\"  Huang added that he was seeing \"quite a significant boom\" in this area, with salaries nearly doubling.  \"And so we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories,\" he added.

Kristalina Georgieva, managing director at the International Monetary Fund, said Tuesday that AI is \"hitting the labor market like a tsunami, and most countries and most businesses are not prepared for it.\"  However,  found that blue-collar jobs were the least likely to be automated and hence safer from job cuts and layoffs. The roles named ranged from phlebotomists to helpers, painters, plasterers, and ship engineers.  The research, which analyzed data from 200,000 conversations with Microsoft Bing Copilot between January and September 2024, focused on how much users sought assistance from the chatbot to complete a task. Professionals who did physical work, whether with people or machines, were least likely to rely on AI.  \"Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don't need to have a PhD in computer science to do so,\" Huang said.  Roxana Mînzatu, EVP for social rights and skills, quality jobs, and preparedness at the European Commission, told CNBC in a conversation at WEF that young people should pursue vocational training in order to secure these blue-collar roles.  \"There are a lot of job offers in the vocational direction. I've had a discussion with the semiconductor industry, those that produce the chips for communication. They're looking for 75,000 vocational trained people — technicians [and] different types of degrees,\" Mînzatu said.  When asked about AI taking away entry-level roles and making it harder to enter the job market, she said: \"I'm not that concerned about the ability of the young generation to be able to have the right skills for that.\"  Meanwhile, blue-collar jobs do appear to be   — those born between 1997 and 2012 — in part because of the high cost of getting a bachelor's degree in the U.S. CNBC Make It calculations in 2025 indicated that the annual cost of attending a four-year, in-state public college increased by about 30% between 2011 and 2023. \"There are about 2 million fewer students in a traditional four-year university now than in 2011,\"  , senior economist at payroll and benefits platform Gusto, told CNBC Make It at the time.

The stock jumped about 11% on Wednesday to its highest since January 2022, continuing a rally that lifted it 84% last year and bringing its gains over the past 12 months to 149%. Much of the optimism is tied to strong sales of Intel's latest server chips, which analysts say are benefitting from rising spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure. KeyBanc analysts upgraded the stock to the equivalent of a buy earlier this month, suggesting that Intel is likely sold out of server CPUs for this year, meaning prices could be on the rise.  \"We expect outsized data center demand from hyperscalers this year to be a significant tailwind\" for Intel's data center business, the KeyBanc analysts wrote. They have a price target of $60 for the stock, which closed above $54 on Wednesday.  Intel is also getting a boost from recent indications that the company's foundry business, which is still seeking an anchor customer, could start to secure orders and become the No. 2 chip foundry behind   and ahead of Samsung.  Intel recently touted its 18A manufacturing technology, seen as equivalent to TSMC's 2 nanometer process technology. The U.S. government has become a key backer of Intel, making it the largest shareholder after an $8.9 billion investment last year, partially because it's the only American company capable of making advanced chips.  , the leading maker of AI chips and a prospective customer for Intel's factories, is one of the top shareholders in the company after a $5 billion investment last year.

Nvidia's stake has grown by more than $6 billion since its investment the following month.   was appointed to the top job  , and has since slashed costs, cut jobs and re-organized the leadership structure.  Analysts expect Intel to report a 6% drop in year-over-year revenue for the fourth quarter to $13.4 billion, according to LSEG.

Major U.S. stock averages jumped Wednesday after President Donald Trump said he would no longer impose his new Europe tariffs that were set to begin Feb. 1 and  .  Trump, who has been relentlessly pushing for U.S. control of Greenland in recent weeks, said Wednesday on   that he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte have \"formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland.\" The president later   that \"we have a concept of a deal\" with the Arctic island. Stocks were already rising after the U.S. president earlier said in a speech at the   in Davos, Switzerland, that he would not move to acquire Greenland by force. The S&P 500 ended the day up more than 1%, and the 30-stock Dow surged almost 600 points, or more than 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also advanced more than 1%. The   index of small-cap stocks gained about 2% and notched a record close. \"The Greenland crisis appears to be defusing and reversing the recent sell-off, although details are still forthcoming around the 'framework,'\" said Eric Teal, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management. He said that the relief rally sparked significant gains in traditional value sectors such as financials and energy stocks. While equities rose in the wake of the deal \"framework\" announcement, the situation appears far from over. On Thursday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen viewed Trump's discussion on Arctic security with Rutte as \" \" and said that the country is ready to hold talks with the U.S. on its \" \" missile defense plan. However, she stressed that sovereignty is non-negotiable. \"The Kingdom of Denmark wishes to continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with allies on how we can strengthen security in the Arctic, including the US's Golden Dome, provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity,\" Frederiksen said.

Inflation drifted slightly further from the Federal Reserve's target in November though in line with expectations, according to the central bank's preferred gauge released Thursday. The personal consumption expenditures price index, a Commerce Department measure the central bank uses as its main forecasting tool, showed inflation at 2.8% for the month, in line with the Dow Jones consensus. In addition, the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the rate for October was 2.7% on both a headline and core basis, the latter excluding volatile food and energy prices.  .

Analyst Brad Reback expects Datadog to post better-than-expected earnings next month. He sees the company reporting more than 23% growth. Shares were up 6% in morning trading Thursday. Last quarter, Datadog beat analyst expectations and grew revenue 28% year over year. While competition and acquisitions in the cloud platform space have caused concerns among analysts, Reback remains optimistic. \"While Palo's acquisition of Chronosphere and Snowflake's recent acquisition of Observe play into the negative narrative around the crowding in the observability space and that pricing will continue to broadly compress, given the time it will take to integrate these acquisitions into their respective organizations as well as the time to adapt to the new GTM strategy/buyer, we believe the near-term impact on Datadog's growth rate should be limited,\" Reback wrote.  \"Over the medium term, we note that DDOG has effectively worked with customers to ensure value based pricing and we think the platforms overall ease of use should enable the company to at least sustain current growth rates,\" he added.  —  The three leading U.S. indexes began Thursday's session in positive territory.

The uptick reflected higher revisions in consumer spending, exports, government and investment. Also, imports decreased amid the ongoing global tariff skirmish between the U.S. and its trading partners. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity, rose at a 3.5% rate for the quarter. Final sales to domestic purchasers, a proxy for demand across the $31 trillion economy, accelerated at a 6.3% rate, the highest since Q3 of 2023. The stellar year for U.S. growth is expected to continue through the fourth quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's   running tracker of incoming data is putting the Q4 figure at 5.4%.

Much of the bullish sentiment is driven by enthusiasm on Intel's latest server chips, as well as investments last year from   and   into Intel. Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius Research, wrote in a note to clients that Intel's strong performance could signal more value ahead for its foundry business. \"Since Lip-Bu Tan was announced as CEO, shares of Intel have risen about 160%, with most of that performance coming since September when shortages started to become a big thing. Intel has the backing of Nvidia and the U.S. Government, who both look very smart right now. Intel is also now part of the vast 'shortage cohort' along with  ,   and other rocket ships ... Surging data center capex is driving up demand for Intel's server CPUs and advanced packaging assets for chips,\" Reitzes wrote. \"There is another issue reverberating throughout 'the shortage world,' specific to Intel but forgotten by haters. The more TSMC raises prices and is forced to give Nvidia and Broadcom huge AI chip allocations, the more an elephant like Apple will be forced to engage with Intel for its Foundry,\" he added Shares of   dropped 3.5% after the company issued disappointing first-quarter guidance.

Huang, one of the foremost voices on artificial intelligence, struck an optimistic tone on its impact on the labor market in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos Wednesday.  \"This is the largest infrastructure build-out in human history that's going to create a lot of jobs,\" Huang said. \"It's wonderful that the jobs are related to trade craft, and we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steel workers, and network technicians, and people who install and fit out the equipment.\"  Huang added that he was seeing \"quite a significant boom\" in this area, with salaries nearly doubling.  \"And so we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories,\" he added.

Kristalina Georgieva, managing director at the International Monetary Fund, said Tuesday that AI is \"hitting the labor market like a tsunami, and most countries and most businesses are not prepared for it.\"  However,  found that blue-collar jobs were the least likely to be automated and hence safer from job cuts and layoffs. The roles named ranged from phlebotomists to helpers, painters, plasterers, and ship engineers.  The research, which analyzed data from 200,000 conversations with Microsoft Bing Copilot between January and September 2024, focused on how much users sought assistance from the chatbot to complete a task. Professionals who did physical work, whether with people or machines, were least likely to rely on AI.  \"Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don't need to have a PhD in computer science to do so,\" Huang said.  Roxana Mînzatu, EVP for social rights and skills, quality jobs, and preparedness at the European Commission, told CNBC in a conversation at WEF that young people should pursue vocational training in order to secure these blue-collar roles.  \"There are a lot of job offers in the vocational direction. I've had a discussion with the semiconductor industry, those that produce the chips for communication. They're looking for 75,000 vocational trained people — technicians [and] different types of degrees,\" Mînzatu said.  When asked about AI taking away entry-level roles and making it harder to enter the job market, she said: \"I'm not that concerned about the ability of the young generation to be able to have the right skills for that.\"  Meanwhile, blue-collar jobs do appear to be   — those born between 1997 and 2012 — in part because of the high cost of getting a bachelor's degree in the U.S. CNBC Make It calculations in 2025 indicated that the annual cost of attending a four-year, in-state public college increased by about 30% between 2011 and 2023. \"There are about 2 million fewer students in a traditional four-year university now than in 2011,\"  , senior economist at payroll and benefits platform Gusto, told CNBC Make It at the time.

European industrial and manufacturing giants, including  ,  ,   and  , have all announced robotics projects and partnerships with robotics tech companies in the past year.

Tech investors have taken note. Companies building robotics raised a record $26.5 billion in 2025, according to deal counting platform Dealroom. To take advantage of the opportunity in AI, Europe has to \"get serious\" about its energy supply so that it can invest in the infrastructure layer, Huang said.

                "full_text": "In this article U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to grant Nvidia licenses to ship some of its more powerful artificial intelligence chips to China is ruffling the feathers of some of Washington's most prominent China hawks, including members of his own party.  The pushback intensified this week with the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee advancing a  that seeks to expand congressional oversight of AI chip exports. The proposal, known as the AI Overwatch Act, was introduced last month by Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., the committee chairman. It would require both the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Banking Committee to approve any shipment licenses for advanced chips in 30 days, giving lawmakers the power to block sales through a joint resolution. The bill comes as the Trump Administration plans to grant licenses allowing   to sell its H200 chips to China, which are far more powerful than the processors previously permitted for export.  If passed, the AI Overwatch Act would revoke existing licenses for such AI chip transfers and impose a temporary ban until the administration submits a national security strategy on AI exports. It includes exemptions for \"trusted\" U.S. companies shipping chips abroad under U.S. control, provided they meet security standards. \"Companies like Nvidia are requesting to sell millions of advanced AI chips, which are the cutting edge of warfare, to Chinese military companies like   and  ,\" said Chairman Mast, framing it as a national security risk.  The bill was also cosponsored by the Republican Chairman of the Select Committee on China, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., who   a \"critical step toward protecting America's technological edge.\" Still, it remains unclear the extent of support that the AI Overwatch Act can attract in the House and Senate.  The act is likely to serve as a linchpin in a larger battle developing in Washington between lawmakers who see Nvidia chip exports as a national security risk and officials who argue that the exports help maintain U.S. technological dominance. Among the latter camp is White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, who has already criticized the AI Overwatch Act. The Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor recently   a viral social media claim that the bill would undermine Trump's authority over AI chip exports. Sacks and those in the Trump administration who support more Nvidia shipments overseas have argued that U.S. chip restrictions have been counterproductive and have ceded ground to Chinese competitors.  Instead, they say it is advantageous for U.S.-designed chips to remain at the center of global AI infrastructure.  This is consistent with arguments made by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and industry lobbyists. Bipartisan lawmakers on the other side, however, have argued that Nvidia's H200s could bolster China's AI capabilities and be leveraged by its military.  Current U.S. chip controls require individual licenses from the Commerce Department for any exports or transfers of high-performance AI chips to entities in \"countries of concern,\" including China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. These controls have covered Nvidia's H200, one of its most powerful AI chips. But last week, Trump confirmed his administration   of the processors to China, provided the U.S. receives a 25% cut of the proceeds. Much of the pushback from lawmakers has come from the opposition party. In December, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., criticized Trump's approval of H200 exports as evidence of a \"haphazard and transactional approach\" lacking a coherent strategy against China.  \"American companies must remain the undisputed leader in AI hardware because our strategic competition with China on AI will boil down to whose ecosystem drives adoption and innovation globally,\" he said. Meanwhile, Senate Banking Committee ranking member Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has also warned that China seeks such chips for military modernization, weapons design and AI surveillance, citing Justice Department assessments. However, Trump has also faced bipartisan resistance. Before the H200, the president had also announced he would allow Nvidia to resume its sales of the H20 to China, a chip the President had restricted just months earlier.  At the time, lawmakers had also responded with additional AI chip proposals, including the   introduced in November by a bipartisan group that included Warren and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. The bill would require U.S. firms to prioritize domestic sales of advanced chips before exporting to China.  Despite Trump's policy shifts on chip exports, Chinese regulators have not allowed Nvidia's chips to flow back into the country freely.  Reuters   last week that Chinese customs authorities have been instructed to block imports of H200 chips and warned tech companies against purchasing them unless necessary.",

                "full_text": "In this article The future of the   company – its iconic movie studio, HBO Max, and its cable networks, including CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery and HGTV – may come down to what European regulators think about  . That's a pretty crazy twist for a deal that will dictate the future of many valuable American sports rights – assets that, for the most part, have very little to do with Europe. A quick refresher: WBD owns many live U.S. sports rights, including those to March Madness, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, the French Open, AEW, the College Football Playoffs and others. But those rights wouldn't go to Netflix under   to sell some of its assets to the streaming giant. Netflix has agreed to pay $27.75 per share for the WBD movie studio and streaming business, but not the cable networks, which own the sports rights. If the deal is approved, those networks would get spun out into a separate publicly traded entity called Discovery Global, which would also own Bleacher Report, House of Highlights and WBD's other digital assets. If WBD shareholders accept a   from  , however – and if that deal is approved – the cable networks and associated sports would all fall under the Paramount umbrella. Paramount has bid $30 per share for the entirety of WBD – an offer it has taken directly to shareholders after the WBD board rejected it. Paramount on Thursday   on its tender offer — which expired Wednesday — giving WBD shareholders more time to weigh the option.  WBD responded with a statement, noting that less than 7% of all shareholders have tendered their shares thus far to Paramount. \"Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. It's also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount's inferior scheme,\" WBD said. \"We are confident in our ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Netflix merger and look forward to delivering the tremendous and certain value our agreement will provide to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.\" Most media attention has focused on what U.S. President Donald Trump   a Netflix-WBD deal. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Trump ahead of the deal to gauge his sentiment on a transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice — theoretically an independent body from the presidency – will ultimately decide whether or not the deal presents antitrust problems, and if those issues can be ameliorated with conditions or if they're simply too big for a deal to go through. There's been far less attention paid to Europe, which will also need to approve a deal. And that's where either deal could fall apart.  Netflix is a global company, generating about $14.5 billion in revenue in its \"EMEA\" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region last year, or about 32% of total sales.  WBD feels confident its Netflix deal will win EU approval, according to people familiar with the matter. A WBD source said there was a \"95% certainty\" that Europe would approve the transaction, though the person did acknowledge Netflix may need to agree to certain conditions, such as agreeing to produce a certain amount of local content in Europe and promising to release movies into theaters. The EU's   already mandates that video-on-demand streaming services ensure at least 30% of programming in EU countries qualify as European works.  Paramount disagrees and believes a Netflix deal has very little chance of making it past European regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. At the same time, it's working its own EU regulatory angles for its proposed takeover. It would be unusual but not unprecedented for European regulators to block a deal between two U.S.-based companies.     $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma in December 2023 after deciding there was \"no clear path\" to gaining antitrust approval in Europe and the U.K. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority     Facebook to sell Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks, in 2022. The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. . It's also worth noting the European Commission allowed Amazon to acquire MGM, perhaps the closest comparison in terms of comparative businesses to this deal. Paramount's confidence stems from the continent's track record of being tough on tech companies, with antitrust crackdowns and penalties   Meta,  ,     and Amazon in recent years. Paramount executives believe EU regulators view Netflix similarly, based on recent conversations they've had with European officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Given the chance to stop a Big Tech company from gaining even more market power, Paramount executives believe Europe will take it. The EU may also be more parochial in how it treats movie theater owners, viewing them as essential to culture and art. Both U.S. and European trade associations for the cinema industry have   their   with a Netflix-Warner combination. This week, Sarandos reiterated that Warner Bros. films will be released in theaters with a 45-day window — as they always have. \"We're working closely with WBD and the regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals,\" Sarandos said Tuesday during   \"When this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled, world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. And we're excited to maintain it and further strengthen that business.\" The WBD board viewed two movie studios coming together – Paramount and Warner – as a bigger regulatory hurdle than any issue presented by Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, WBD's lawyers have determined both deals – Netflix-WBD and Paramount-WBD – would likely gain approval. \"The WBD Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the [Paramount tender] Offer with its regulatory advisors,\" WBD said in a December corporate filing. \"The WBD Board is of the view that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material.\" On the movie theater issue, a Warner source told me WBD actually views Paramount as a potentially bigger issue than Netflix. That's because WBD's board and executives aren't sure Paramount will have the money to produce 30 or more movies a year (a Paramount CEO David Ellison  ) while also paying down billions of dollars in debt and targeting $6 billion in cost savings.  This is why the structure of the Paramount deal is so important to WBD. To create a superior deal for WBD, Larry Ellison, David's father and one of the world's wealthiest men, would need to put up more money in equity to lower the leverage ratio of a combined company. The board doesn't trust Paramount can deliver on its synergies while also meeting its aggressive theatrical goals and moving forward with a leverage ratio over 7-times estimated 2026 EBITDA. This week, Netflix changed its offer for WBD's assets from mostly cash to  . Simplifying the bid allows WBD to move its shareholder meeting to approve the Netflix offer earlier – possibly as early as March, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount is still considering if it wants to raise its bid or change the capital structure to re-engage the WBD board, according to people familiar with the matter. It could also do nothing and wait to see if it's right about regulators – either European or American – blocking a Netflix deal. With so much attention on the importance of live sports to the TV industry, it's unusual to see them as such an afterthought. Paramount executives have argued the value of Discovery Global should be $0 based on its high leverage ratio and the early valuation of Versant, the parent company of CNBC, which has traded down almost 30% since it debuted on the public markets this month. In a   released Tuesday, WBD argued Discovery Global should be valued between $1.33 per share and $6.86 per share, depending on estimates.",

Stocks were already rising after the U.S. president earlier said in a speech at the   in Davos, Switzerland, that he would not move to acquire Greenland by force. The S&P 500 ended the day up more than 1%, and the 30-stock Dow surged almost 600 points, or more than 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also advanced more than 1%. The   index of small-cap stocks gained about 2% and notched a record close. \"The Greenland crisis appears to be defusing and reversing the recent sell-off, although details are still forthcoming around the 'framework,'\" said Eric Teal, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management. He said that the relief rally sparked significant gains in traditional value sectors such as financials and energy stocks. While equities rose in the wake of the deal \"framework\" announcement, the situation appears far from over. On Thursday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen viewed Trump's discussion on Arctic security with Rutte as \" \" and said that the country is ready to hold talks with the U.S. on its \" \" missile defense plan.

Last quarter, Datadog beat analyst expectations and grew revenue 28% year over year. While competition and acquisitions in the cloud platform space have caused concerns among analysts, Reback remains optimistic. \"While Palo's acquisition of Chronosphere and Snowflake's recent acquisition of Observe play into the negative narrative around the crowding in the observability space and that pricing will continue to broadly compress, given the time it will take to integrate these acquisitions into their respective organizations as well as the time to adapt to the new GTM strategy/buyer, we believe the near-term impact on Datadog's growth rate should be limited,\" Reback wrote.  \"Over the medium term, we note that DDOG has effectively worked with customers to ensure value based pricing and we think the platforms overall ease of use should enable the company to at least sustain current growth rates,\" he added.  —  The three leading U.S. indexes began Thursday's session in positive territory.

Also, imports decreased amid the ongoing global tariff skirmish between the U.S. and its trading partners. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity, rose at a 3.5% rate for the quarter.

If the deal is approved, those networks would get spun out into a separate publicly traded entity called Discovery Global, which would also own Bleacher Report, House of Highlights and WBD's other digital assets. If WBD shareholders accept a   from  , however – and if that deal is approved – the cable networks and associated sports would all fall under the Paramount umbrella. Paramount has bid $30 per share for the entirety of WBD – an offer it has taken directly to shareholders after the WBD board rejected it. Paramount on Thursday   on its tender offer — which expired Wednesday — giving WBD shareholders more time to weigh the option.  WBD responded with a statement, noting that less than 7% of all shareholders have tendered their shares thus far to Paramount. \"Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. It's also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount's inferior scheme,\" WBD said. \"We are confident in our ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Netflix merger and look forward to delivering the tremendous and certain value our agreement will provide to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.\" Most media attention has focused on what U.S. President Donald Trump   a Netflix-WBD deal. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Trump ahead of the deal to gauge his sentiment on a transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice — theoretically an independent body from the presidency – will ultimately decide whether or not the deal presents antitrust problems, and if those issues can be ameliorated with conditions or if they're simply too big for a deal to go through. There's been far less attention paid to Europe, which will also need to approve a deal. And that's where either deal could fall apart.  Netflix is a global company, generating about $14.5 billion in revenue in its \"EMEA\" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region last year, or about 32% of total sales.  WBD feels confident its Netflix deal will win EU approval, according to people familiar with the matter. A WBD source said there was a \"95% certainty\" that Europe would approve the transaction, though the person did acknowledge Netflix may need to agree to certain conditions, such as agreeing to produce a certain amount of local content in Europe and promising to release movies into theaters. The EU's   already mandates that video-on-demand streaming services ensure at least 30% of programming in EU countries qualify as European works.  Paramount disagrees and believes a Netflix deal has very little chance of making it past European regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. At the same time, it's working its own EU regulatory angles for its proposed takeover. It would be unusual but not unprecedented for European regulators to block a deal between two U.S.-based companies.     $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma in December 2023 after deciding there was \"no clear path\" to gaining antitrust approval in Europe and the U.K. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority     Facebook to sell Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks, in 2022. The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. . It's also worth noting the European Commission allowed Amazon to acquire MGM, perhaps the closest comparison in terms of comparative businesses to this deal. Paramount's confidence stems from the continent's track record of being tough on tech companies, with antitrust crackdowns and penalties   Meta,  ,     and Amazon in recent years. Paramount executives believe EU regulators view Netflix similarly, based on recent conversations they've had with European officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Given the chance to stop a Big Tech company from gaining even more market power, Paramount executives believe Europe will take it. The EU may also be more parochial in how it treats movie theater owners, viewing them as essential to culture and art. Both U.S. and European trade associations for the cinema industry have   their   with a Netflix-Warner combination. This week, Sarandos reiterated that Warner Bros. films will be released in theaters with a 45-day window — as they always have. \"We're working closely with WBD and the regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals,\" Sarandos said Tuesday during   \"When this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled, world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. And we're excited to maintain it and further strengthen that business.\" The WBD board viewed two movie studios coming together – Paramount and Warner – as a bigger regulatory hurdle than any issue presented by Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, WBD's lawyers have determined both deals – Netflix-WBD and Paramount-WBD – would likely gain approval. \"The WBD Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the [Paramount tender] Offer with its regulatory advisors,\" WBD said in a December corporate filing. \"The WBD Board is of the view that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material.\" On the movie theater issue, a Warner source told me WBD actually views Paramount as a potentially bigger issue than Netflix. That's because WBD's board and executives aren't sure Paramount will have the money to produce 30 or more movies a year (a Paramount CEO David Ellison  ) while also paying down billions of dollars in debt and targeting $6 billion in cost savings.  This is why the structure of the Paramount deal is so important to WBD. To create a superior deal for WBD, Larry Ellison, David's father and one of the world's wealthiest men, would need to put up more money in equity to lower the leverage ratio of a combined company. The board doesn't trust Paramount can deliver on its synergies while also meeting its aggressive theatrical goals and moving forward with a leverage ratio over 7-times estimated 2026 EBITDA. This week, Netflix changed its offer for WBD's assets from mostly cash to  . Simplifying the bid allows WBD to move its shareholder meeting to approve the Netflix offer earlier – possibly as early as March, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount is still considering if it wants to raise its bid or change the capital structure to re-engage the WBD board, according to people familiar with the matter. It could also do nothing and wait to see if it's right about regulators – either European or American – blocking a Netflix deal. With so much attention on the importance of live sports to the TV industry, it's unusual to see them as such an afterthought. Paramount executives have argued the value of Discovery Global should be $0 based on its high leverage ratio and the early valuation of Versant, the parent company of CNBC, which has traded down almost 30% since it debuted on the public markets this month. In a   released Tuesday, WBD argued Discovery Global should be valued between $1.33 per share and $6.86 per share, depending on estimates.",

Hassett had been   to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May, but prediction markets showed former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh moved ahead in the race following the president's remarks. Traders see Hassett as the more market-friendly option to replace Powell, with Wall Street expecting him to be more willing than Warsh to keep rates low. \"Whether it's Hassett or someone else, I think the assumption that we — at least most of us — have is that whoever it's going to be, this person is going to certainly have a political motive and not the more traditional, trying-to-be-fully-objective mindset in regards to leading the Fed,\" said David Krakauer, vice president of portfolio management at Mercer Advisors. \"That threat to the independence of the Fed is certainly, you know, a concern for us and everyone.\" The major averages are coming off a winning session thanks to gains in chip stocks.   led the advance after a blowout fourth-quarter report.

Analyst Eugene Hsiao upgraded Nio to outperform from neutral in a Friday note to clients, citing the company's Battery-as-a-Service as a key differentiator, with more than 80% of customers opting to lease the battery rather than purchase it outright. This model means rising lithium costs could have a lower direct impact on margins for Nio, Hsiao said.  \"Volumes remain challenging, but we think NIO is at a point where high upfront spending on battery swapping and service centers provides an edge. A unique BaaS offering provides a strong alternative to traditional EV ownership; rising Onvo sales could provide a lifeline,\" the analyst wrote.

Analyst Michael Montani's price forecast of $165, up from $125, implies an additional upside of 17% from here. Montani said that his conviction in Dollar Tree's ability to execute rose following an Orlando store tour and deep dive with CFO Steward Glendinning. \"We see Dollar Tree's multi-price point merchandising strategy as a way to drive newness and relevance in its assortment.

Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman on Friday indicated that there is room ahead for more interest rate cuts as the central bank should prioritize getting ahead of potential weakness in the labor market. Speaking at an economic forum in Foxborough,  Mass., the policymaker advocated a forward-looking approach based on \"informed\" forecasts rather than the solely data-dependent policy many of her fellow officials back. \"Absent a clear and sustained improvement in labor market conditions, we should remain ready to adjust policy to bring it closer to neutral,\" Bowman said. \"We should also avoid signaling that we will pause without identifying that conditions have changed. Doing so will indicate that we are not attentive or responsive to the recent and expected path of the labor market.\" The central bank official added that she sees inflation \"on a sustained trajectory\" to the Fed's 2% goal countered by \"growing labor market fragility\" that the Fed should head move to \"preemptively stabilize.\" Bowman is under consideration for to take over the chair position when Jerome Powell's term expires in May, though prediction markets rate her to be an extreme longshot. Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh on Friday vaulted to the front of the pack in the race for central bank chair following remarks from President Donald Trump, according to a closely watched prediction market. Traders on Kalshi pushed Warsh well ahead of the person seen as his closest competitor, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. In remarks delivered Friday morning, Trump, without explicitly stating his decision, said he'd prefer to keep Hassett in his position as top economic advisor. \"I see Kevin's in the audience, and I just want to thank you.

Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said Novo's weight loss pill accounted for about 1.3% of all Wegovy prescriptions in its very first week of launch.

Bank of America Securities downgraded   to underperform from neutral on Tuesday, saying it sees better opportunities elsewhere. ConocoPhillips's oil breakeven is $53 U.S. West Texas Intermediate, which is materially higher than other oil and gas names, analyst Kalei Akamine said in a note to clients. An oil breakeven price is essentially the minimum price a company needs to cover its costs. In addition, the company's debt-adjusted free cash flow yield is an uncompetitive 4.4%, he said.  \"These headwinds are being driven in part by long-cycle spending on Port Arthur LNG and Willow, with start-up still two and four years away, respectively,\" Akamine wrote. \"At our forecast of $57 WTI, we do not believe COP can sustain its recent pace of returning 45% of cash flow.\" At the same time, Akamine upgraded   to buy on the strength of its oil breakeven price of $37. He also said there is \"the potential for a stronger‑than‑expected oil guide driven by what we view as solid operating momentum exiting 4Q25.\" Akamine raised his price target to $28 from $26, implying 24.5%  upside from Thursday's close.

On Tuesday, the airline revised its earnings guidance to $6.50-$7.50 per share for 2026, or below the Street's consensus estimate of about $7.30, according to a Bank of America note to clients dated Friday.  However, analysts shook off the downward revision following a call with investors and Delta CFO Dan Janki this week. They stressed that the firm's strong cash generation and focus on premium travel are reasons to remain bullish on the stock.  \"The call reinforced our thesis that DAL is a key structural leader in the airline industry given its premium revenue focus, strong cash generation, low leverage, and diversified revenue streams (loyalty, MRO),\" analyst Andrew Didora said in the note.  He added that Delta \"remains positive on fundamentals,\" as its customers, particularly clients that opt for its premium services, prove resilient to rising macroeconomic volatility.

It presents an opportunity to \"leap past\" the era of software, he added, which has been led by the U.S. Attention across the industrial and tech sectors has increasingly shifted to autonomous robotics as recent advances in AI promise more capabilities.  European industrial and manufacturing giants, including  ,  ,   and  , have all announced robotics projects and partnerships with robotics tech companies in the past year.

Tech investors have taken note. Companies building robotics raised a record $26.5 billion in 2025, according to deal counting platform Dealroom. To take advantage of the opportunity in AI, Europe has to \"get serious\" about its energy supply so that it can invest in the infrastructure layer, Huang said.  The region has some of the highest energy costs in the world. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said energy costs will be a key factor in determining how successful countries are in the   at WEF on Tuesday. \"I think that it's fairly certain that you have to get serious about increasing your energy supply so that you could invest in the infrastructure layer, so that you could have a rich ecosystem of artificial intelligence here in Europe,\" Huang said. Europe has been grappling with   as hyperscalers look to roll out AI infrastructure across the region.  That rapid buildout is showing no signs of slowing down, said Huang. AI has started the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" he told the audience at WEF. \"We're now a few hundred billion dollars into it.

In addition to YouTube, companies such as   and TikTok rely on recommendation systems powered by AI that surface personalized videos designed to keep users engaged for longer periods of time. Mohan said the world is at an \"inflection point,\" where \"the lines between creativity and technology are blurring.\" \"To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we're actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content,\" Mohan wrote.  He said that YouTube clearly labels videos created by AI products and requires creators to disclose if they've produced altered content. The company's systems also remove \"harmful synthetic media\" that violates its guidelines, Mohan wrote.  Critical to YouTube's growth among users, creators and advertisers is keeping the platform desirable for all parties involved.  In December, YouTube said it would be   its \"likeness detection,\" which flags when a creator's face is used without their permission in deepfakes. The feature is being rolled out to millions of creators in the YouTube Partner Program. Mohan's letter said the company will use AI as a tool and \"not a replacement,\" adding that on average more than 1 million YouTube channels used its artificial intelligence creation technology daily in December. The company is expanding the way creators can take advantage of AI, he said, including on YouTube's short-form video offering called Shorts, which competes with TikTok and Instagram Reels.  \"This year you'll be able to create a Short using your own likeness, produce games with a simple text prompt, and experiment with music,\" he wrote.  Mohan described creators as \"the new stars and studios,\" and said YouTube creators are \"buying studio-sized lots in Hollywood and beyond to pioneer new formats and produce beautifully produced, must-see TV.\"  The company also wants to provide new ways for creators to earn, from \"shopping and brand deals to fan funding features like Jewels and gifts.\" Another priority, Mohan said, is making YouTube \"the best place for kids and teens\" and said this year the company plans to make it easier for parents to set up new kid accounts and to easily switch between them. YouTube   in September that it's paid out more than $100 billion to creators, artists and media companies since 2021. Earlier in the year, analysts at MoffettNathanson   that If it was a stand-alone business, YouTube would be worth between $475 billion and $550 billion.",

                "full_text": "In this article When   agreed to spend a reported $2 billion on   at the end of last year, the social media giant said it planned to take the startup's subscription AI agent offering and \"scale this service to many more businesses.\" But some existing Manus customers aren't thrilled with the deal and say they're now going elsewhere, the latest sign of skepticism toward Meta as it tries to compete with the likes of OpenAI,   and Anthropic in the booming artificial intelligence market.  Manus, a developer of general purpose AI agents, was founded in China in 2022 before relocating to Singapore. Last year, the company launched its first general AI agent, which can be customized to execute complex tasks such as market research, coding and data analysis.  Seth Dobrin, co-founder and CEO of Arya Labs, said Manus was his favorite agentic AI platform, but his company, which develops a type of so-called world models, is no longer using it under Meta's ownership. Dobrin told CNBC that while he had confidence in Manus' transparent terms of service, he doesn't have that level of trust in Meta and is \"legitimately sad that this has happened.\" \"I do not agree with a lot of Meta's practices around data and how they essentially weaponize people's personal data against them,\" said Dobrin, who helped launch Arya last year. \"I don't want to engage with a company who I don't feel comfortable with how they're going to use data.\" Meta, which gets almost all of its $200 billion in annualized revenue from ads,   on Dec. 29, that its purchase of Manus was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.  Manus said in a   on the day of the deal that it had reached millions of paying customers and a revenue run rate of more than $125 million. \"Our top priority is ensuring that this change won't be disruptive for our customers,\"  Manus said. \"We will continue to sell and operate our product subscription service through our app and website. The company will continue to operate from Singapore.\" Despite those assurances, Dobrin isn't alone in his concern. Karl Yeh, co-founder of consulting firm  , which advises startups on how to integrate AI tools, said he stopped using Manus at his company and has advised his clients to follow suit.  \"Will the data policies of Meta apply to Manus? I would assume it will eventually,\" Yeh told CNBC. \"That was the concern we had and why we stopped recommending it to our clients.\" \"We don't know where Manus is going to fit into Meta's AI road map,\" Yeh said. \"We're not sure if Manus is going to still remain a separate company even though they said it would.\" Yeh said he's moving to services from a startup called Genspark or somewhere else where there's more certainty because, \"In terms of Meta, we're just not sure.\" Meta didn't provide a comment beyond pointing to the blog post, which notes that, \"We're excited to welcome the Manus team and help improve the lives of billions of people and millions of businesses with their technology.\" Meta has opened its wallets to try and win in AI, most notably   more than $14 billion in June to hire Scale AI's Alexandr Wang and a handful of his top engineers and researchers and secure a stake in his startup. But unlike AI model leaders OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, Meta has yet to land on a   in the market, particularly when it comes to competing in the enterprise.  Meta's stock is down 17% since CEO   said on the last   in October that AI costs will keep growing. Analysts anticipate 2026 spending on AI could top $100 billion. Meta is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results next week.  Flo Crivello, CEO of a Manus competitor, Lindy, said his company initially saw a bump in users after news of Meta's acquisition.  \"We think there was sort of a halo effect from the announcement,\" Crivello said. \"It raised awareness about this category of software and people started researching it.\"  Crivello, who previously spent almost five years at   and worked on acquisitions, said he thinks Meta's rationale is less about bringing in enterprise customers, and more targeted at serving small businesses, which have long been crucial to Meta's ad revenue.  Crivello said Manus is \"focused on very small business owners like independent contractors,\" and said it could take a while for Meta to figure out where it takes Manus from here.  \"The way these companies think of these acquisitions, they're acquiring the company for a specific, strategic reason — they just don't know precisely what the integration might look like yet,\" Crivello said. \"They cut a check, it's a new thing they add to the chess board and then they figure it out. And sometimes it takes them years to figure out what to do.\" Outside of advertising, Meta has struggled in several areas where it's tried to crack the enterprise. The company   in 2024 that it was shuttering its Workplace communication and productivity platform, two years after   its Portal video calling device.  Last week, Meta said it's sunsetting its   virtual reality app, part of a broader   from VR, which had been Zuckerberg's big focus area before AI took off.  Navrina Singh, founder and CEO of governance startup Credo AI, says she doesn't see Fortune 500 companies embracing Meta's tools.  \"Among large enterprises — particularly in highly regulated sectors like health care and financial services — many AI deployments today are built on models from providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic,\" Singh said. Then they're typically run through cloud platforms operated by   or  , \"where trust, security, and accountability requirements are well-established and prioritized,\" she said. One area where Meta is finding success in the business world is WhatsApp, the messaging platform it acquired for $19 billion in 2014. WhatsApp for Business has become a popular way for companies to interact with customers. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore, has projected WhatsApp could generate $40 billion in revenue by 2030.  \"Business messaging remains a significant opportunity for us,\" Meta CFO Susan Li said on the company's last earnings call. \"We're also making good progress on our business AI efforts, where we've been focused on building a turnkey AI that helps businesses generate leads and drive sales.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article The future of the   company – its iconic movie studio, HBO Max, and its cable networks, including CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery and HGTV – may come down to what European regulators think about  . That's a pretty crazy twist for a deal that will dictate the future of many valuable American sports rights – assets that, for the most part, have very little to do with Europe. A quick refresher: WBD owns many live U.S. sports rights, including those to March Madness, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, the French Open, AEW, the College Football Playoffs and others. But those rights wouldn't go to Netflix under   to sell some of its assets to the streaming giant. Netflix has agreed to pay $27.75 per share for the WBD movie studio and streaming business, but not the cable networks, which own the sports rights. If the deal is approved, those networks would get spun out into a separate publicly traded entity called Discovery Global, which would also own Bleacher Report, House of Highlights and WBD's other digital assets. If WBD shareholders accept a   from  , however – and if that deal is approved – the cable networks and associated sports would all fall under the Paramount umbrella. Paramount has bid $30 per share for the entirety of WBD – an offer it has taken directly to shareholders after the WBD board rejected it. Paramount on Thursday   on its tender offer — which expired Wednesday — giving WBD shareholders more time to weigh the option.  WBD responded with a statement, noting that less than 7% of all shareholders have tendered their shares thus far to Paramount. \"Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. It's also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount's inferior scheme,\" WBD said. \"We are confident in our ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Netflix merger and look forward to delivering the tremendous and certain value our agreement will provide to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.\" Most media attention has focused on what U.S. President Donald Trump   a Netflix-WBD deal. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Trump ahead of the deal to gauge his sentiment on a transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice — theoretically an independent body from the presidency – will ultimately decide whether or not the deal presents antitrust problems, and if those issues can be ameliorated with conditions or if they're simply too big for a deal to go through. There's been far less attention paid to Europe, which will also need to approve a deal. And that's where either deal could fall apart.  Netflix is a global company, generating about $14.5 billion in revenue in its \"EMEA\" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region last year, or about 32% of total sales.  WBD feels confident its Netflix deal will win EU approval, according to people familiar with the matter. A WBD source said there was a \"95% certainty\" that Europe would approve the transaction, though the person did acknowledge Netflix may need to agree to certain conditions, such as agreeing to produce a certain amount of local content in Europe and promising to release movies into theaters. The EU's   already mandates that video-on-demand streaming services ensure at least 30% of programming in EU countries qualify as European works.  Paramount disagrees and believes a Netflix deal has very little chance of making it past European regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. At the same time, it's working its own EU regulatory angles for its proposed takeover. It would be unusual but not unprecedented for European regulators to block a deal between two U.S.-based companies.     $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma in December 2023 after deciding there was \"no clear path\" to gaining antitrust approval in Europe and the U.K. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority     Facebook to sell Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks, in 2022. The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. . It's also worth noting the European Commission allowed Amazon to acquire MGM, perhaps the closest comparison in terms of comparative businesses to this deal. Paramount's confidence stems from the continent's track record of being tough on tech companies, with antitrust crackdowns and penalties   Meta,  ,     and Amazon in recent years. Paramount executives believe EU regulators view Netflix similarly, based on recent conversations they've had with European officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Given the chance to stop a Big Tech company from gaining even more market power, Paramount executives believe Europe will take it. The EU may also be more parochial in how it treats movie theater owners, viewing them as essential to culture and art. Both U.S. and European trade associations for the cinema industry have   their   with a Netflix-Warner combination. This week, Sarandos reiterated that Warner Bros. films will be released in theaters with a 45-day window — as they always have. \"We're working closely with WBD and the regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals,\" Sarandos said Tuesday during   \"When this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled, world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. And we're excited to maintain it and further strengthen that business.\" The WBD board viewed two movie studios coming together – Paramount and Warner – as a bigger regulatory hurdle than any issue presented by Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, WBD's lawyers have determined both deals – Netflix-WBD and Paramount-WBD – would likely gain approval. \"The WBD Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the [Paramount tender] Offer with its regulatory advisors,\" WBD said in a December corporate filing. \"The WBD Board is of the view that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material.\" On the movie theater issue, a Warner source told me WBD actually views Paramount as a potentially bigger issue than Netflix. That's because WBD's board and executives aren't sure Paramount will have the money to produce 30 or more movies a year (a Paramount CEO David Ellison  ) while also paying down billions of dollars in debt and targeting $6 billion in cost savings.  This is why the structure of the Paramount deal is so important to WBD. To create a superior deal for WBD, Larry Ellison, David's father and one of the world's wealthiest men, would need to put up more money in equity to lower the leverage ratio of a combined company. The board doesn't trust Paramount can deliver on its synergies while also meeting its aggressive theatrical goals and moving forward with a leverage ratio over 7-times estimated 2026 EBITDA. This week, Netflix changed its offer for WBD's assets from mostly cash to  . Simplifying the bid allows WBD to move its shareholder meeting to approve the Netflix offer earlier – possibly as early as March, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount is still considering if it wants to raise its bid or change the capital structure to re-engage the WBD board, according to people familiar with the matter. It could also do nothing and wait to see if it's right about regulators – either European or American – blocking a Netflix deal. With so much attention on the importance of live sports to the TV industry, it's unusual to see them as such an afterthought. Paramount executives have argued the value of Discovery Global should be $0 based on its high leverage ratio and the early valuation of Versant, the parent company of CNBC, which has traded down almost 30% since it debuted on the public markets this month. In a   released Tuesday, WBD argued Discovery Global should be valued between $1.33 per share and $6.86 per share, depending on estimates.",

Analyst Brad Reback expects Datadog to post better-than-expected earnings next month. He sees the company reporting more than 23% growth. Shares were up 6% in morning trading Thursday. Last quarter, Datadog beat analyst expectations and grew revenue 28% year over year. While competition and acquisitions in the cloud platform space have caused concerns among analysts, Reback remains optimistic. \"While Palo's acquisition of Chronosphere and Snowflake's recent acquisition of Observe play into the negative narrative around the crowding in the observability space and that pricing will continue to broadly compress, given the time it will take to integrate these acquisitions into their respective organizations as well as the time to adapt to the new GTM strategy/buyer, we believe the near-term impact on Datadog's growth rate should be limited,\" Reback wrote.  \"Over the medium term, we note that DDOG has effectively worked with customers to ensure value based pricing and we think the platforms overall ease of use should enable the company to at least sustain current growth rates,\" he added.  —  The three leading U.S. indexes began Thursday's session in positive territory.

The uptick reflected higher revisions in consumer spending, exports, government and investment. Also, imports decreased amid the ongoing global tariff skirmish between the U.S. and its trading partners. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity, rose at a 3.5% rate for the quarter. Final sales to domestic purchasers, a proxy for demand across the $31 trillion economy, accelerated at a 6.3% rate, the highest since Q3 of 2023. The stellar year for U.S. growth is expected to continue through the fourth quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's   running tracker of incoming data is putting the Q4 figure at 5.4%. Initial jobless claims were little changed last week, continuing a low-layoff trend that is putting a floor under the labor market. First-time filings for unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 200,000 for the week ended Jan. 17, up 1,000 from the prior week and below the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 208,000, according to a Labor Department report Thursday. On a four-week moving basis, claims have averaged 201,500, the lowest since Jan. 13, 2024. Continuing claims, which run a week behind, edged lower to 1.85 million, down 26,000 from a week ago.

Huang, one of the foremost voices on artificial intelligence, struck an optimistic tone on its impact on the labor market in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos Wednesday.  \"This is the largest infrastructure build-out in human history that's going to create a lot of jobs,\" Huang said. \"It's wonderful that the jobs are related to trade craft, and we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steel workers, and network technicians, and people who install and fit out the equipment.\"  Huang added that he was seeing \"quite a significant boom\" in this area, with salaries nearly doubling.  \"And so we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories,\" he added. The possibility of AI eliminating jobs has dominated conversations at WEF this week after the technology was seen as contributing to   in the U.S. in 2025, per December data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. ,  ,  , and   were among the companies citing AI as a reason for  .  Kristalina Georgieva, managing director at the International Monetary Fund, said Tuesday that AI is \"hitting the labor market like a tsunami, and most countries and most businesses are not prepared for it.\"  However,  found that blue-collar jobs were the least likely to be automated and hence safer from job cuts and layoffs. The roles named ranged from phlebotomists to helpers, painters, plasterers, and ship engineers.  The research, which analyzed data from 200,000 conversations with Microsoft Bing Copilot between January and September 2024, focused on how much users sought assistance from the chatbot to complete a task. Professionals who did physical work, whether with people or machines, were least likely to rely on AI.  \"Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don't need to have a PhD in computer science to do so,\" Huang said.  Roxana Mînzatu, EVP for social rights and skills, quality jobs, and preparedness at the European Commission, told CNBC in a conversation at WEF that young people should pursue vocational training in order to secure these blue-collar roles.  \"There are a lot of job offers in the vocational direction. I've had a discussion with the semiconductor industry, those that produce the chips for communication. They're looking for 75,000 vocational trained people — technicians [and] different types of degrees,\" Mînzatu said.  When asked about AI taking away entry-level roles and making it harder to enter the job market, she said: \"I'm not that concerned about the ability of the young generation to be able to have the right skills for that.\"  Meanwhile, blue-collar jobs do appear to be   — those born between 1997 and 2012 — in part because of the high cost of getting a bachelor's degree in the U.S. CNBC Make It calculations in 2025 indicated that the annual cost of attending a four-year, in-state public college increased by about 30% between 2011 and 2023. \"There are about 2 million fewer students in a traditional four-year university now than in 2011,\"  , senior economist at payroll and benefits platform Gusto, told CNBC Make It at the time.

It presents an opportunity to \"leap past\" the era of software, he added, which has been led by the U.S. Attention across the industrial and tech sectors has increasingly shifted to autonomous robotics as recent advances in AI promise more capabilities.  European industrial and manufacturing giants, including  ,  ,   and  , have all announced robotics projects and partnerships with robotics tech companies in the past year.

Tech investors have taken note. Companies building robotics raised a record $26.5 billion in 2025, according to deal counting platform Dealroom. To take advantage of the opportunity in AI, Europe has to \"get serious\" about its energy supply so that it can invest in the infrastructure layer, Huang said.  The region has some of the highest energy costs in the world. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said energy costs will be a key factor in determining how successful countries are in the   at WEF on Tuesday. \"I think that it's fairly certain that you have to get serious about increasing your energy supply so that you could invest in the infrastructure layer, so that you could have a rich ecosystem of artificial intelligence here in Europe,\" Huang said. Europe has been grappling with   as hyperscalers look to roll out AI infrastructure across the region.  That rapid buildout is showing no signs of slowing down, said Huang. AI has started the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" he told the audience at WEF. \"We're now a few hundred billion dollars into it. There are trillions of dollars of infrastructure that needs to be built out.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to grant Nvidia licenses to ship some of its more powerful artificial intelligence chips to China is ruffling the feathers of some of Washington's most prominent China hawks, including members of his own party.  The pushback intensified this week with the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee advancing a  that seeks to expand congressional oversight of AI chip exports. The proposal, known as the AI Overwatch Act, was introduced last month by Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., the committee chairman. It would require both the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Banking Committee to approve any shipment licenses for advanced chips in 30 days, giving lawmakers the power to block sales through a joint resolution. The bill comes as the Trump Administration plans to grant licenses allowing   to sell its H200 chips to China, which are far more powerful than the processors previously permitted for export.  If passed, the AI Overwatch Act would revoke existing licenses for such AI chip transfers and impose a temporary ban until the administration submits a national security strategy on AI exports. It includes exemptions for \"trusted\" U.S. companies shipping chips abroad under U.S. control, provided they meet security standards. \"Companies like Nvidia are requesting to sell millions of advanced AI chips, which are the cutting edge of warfare, to Chinese military companies like   and  ,\" said Chairman Mast, framing it as a national security risk.  The bill was also cosponsored by the Republican Chairman of the Select Committee on China, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., who   a \"critical step toward protecting America's technological edge.\" Still, it remains unclear the extent of support that the AI Overwatch Act can attract in the House and Senate.  The act is likely to serve as a linchpin in a larger battle developing in Washington between lawmakers who see Nvidia chip exports as a national security risk and officials who argue that the exports help maintain U.S. technological dominance. Among the latter camp is White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, who has already criticized the AI Overwatch Act. The Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor recently   a viral social media claim that the bill would undermine Trump's authority over AI chip exports. Sacks and those in the Trump administration who support more Nvidia shipments overseas have argued that U.S. chip restrictions have been counterproductive and have ceded ground to Chinese competitors.  Instead, they say it is advantageous for U.S.-designed chips to remain at the center of global AI infrastructure.  This is consistent with arguments made by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and industry lobbyists. Bipartisan lawmakers on the other side, however, have argued that Nvidia's H200s could bolster China's AI capabilities and be leveraged by its military.  Current U.S. chip controls require individual licenses from the Commerce Department for any exports or transfers of high-performance AI chips to entities in \"countries of concern,\" including China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. These controls have covered Nvidia's H200, one of its most powerful AI chips. But last week, Trump confirmed his administration   of the processors to China, provided the U.S. receives a 25% cut of the proceeds. Much of the pushback from lawmakers has come from the opposition party. In December, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., criticized Trump's approval of H200 exports as evidence of a \"haphazard and transactional approach\" lacking a coherent strategy against China.  \"American companies must remain the undisputed leader in AI hardware because our strategic competition with China on AI will boil down to whose ecosystem drives adoption and innovation globally,\" he said. Meanwhile, Senate Banking Committee ranking member Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has also warned that China seeks such chips for military modernization, weapons design and AI surveillance, citing Justice Department assessments. However, Trump has also faced bipartisan resistance. Before the H200, the president had also announced he would allow Nvidia to resume its sales of the H20 to China, a chip the President had restricted just months earlier.  At the time, lawmakers had also responded with additional AI chip proposals, including the   introduced in November by a bipartisan group that included Warren and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. The bill would require U.S. firms to prioritize domestic sales of advanced chips before exporting to China.  Despite Trump's policy shifts on chip exports, Chinese regulators have not allowed Nvidia's chips to flow back into the country freely.  Reuters   last week that Chinese customs authorities have been instructed to block imports of H200 chips and warned tech companies against purchasing them unless necessary.",

Nvidia's stake has grown by more than $6 billion since its investment the following month.   was appointed to the top job  , and has since slashed costs, cut jobs and re-organized the leadership structure.  Analysts expect Intel to report a 6% drop in year-over-year revenue for the fourth quarter to $13.4 billion, according to LSEG. However, they're projecting data center and AI sales to surge nearly 29% to $4.4 billion, according to FactSet estimates.  Other chip stocks rose on Wednesday, including Intel rival  , which gained about 8%, and memory maker  , which climbed 7%.

Huang, one of the foremost voices on artificial intelligence, struck an optimistic tone on its impact on the labor market in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos Wednesday.  \"This is the largest infrastructure build-out in human history that's going to create a lot of jobs,\" Huang said. \"It's wonderful that the jobs are related to trade craft, and we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steel workers, and network technicians, and people who install and fit out the equipment.\"  Huang added that he was seeing \"quite a significant boom\" in this area, with salaries nearly doubling.  \"And so we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories,\" he added. The possibility of AI eliminating jobs has dominated conversations at WEF this week after the technology was seen as contributing to   in the U.S. in 2025, per December data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. ,  ,  , and   were among the companies citing AI as a reason for  .  Kristalina Georgieva, managing director at the International Monetary Fund, said Tuesday that AI is \"hitting the labor market like a tsunami, and most countries and most businesses are not prepared for it.\"  However,  found that blue-collar jobs were the least likely to be automated and hence safer from job cuts and layoffs. The roles named ranged from phlebotomists to helpers, painters, plasterers, and ship engineers.  The research, which analyzed data from 200,000 conversations with Microsoft Bing Copilot between January and September 2024, focused on how much users sought assistance from the chatbot to complete a task. Professionals who did physical work, whether with people or machines, were least likely to rely on AI.  \"Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don't need to have a PhD in computer science to do so,\" Huang said.  Roxana Mînzatu, EVP for social rights and skills, quality jobs, and preparedness at the European Commission, told CNBC in a conversation at WEF that young people should pursue vocational training in order to secure these blue-collar roles.  \"There are a lot of job offers in the vocational direction. I've had a discussion with the semiconductor industry, those that produce the chips for communication. They're looking for 75,000 vocational trained people — technicians [and] different types of degrees,\" Mînzatu said.  When asked about AI taking away entry-level roles and making it harder to enter the job market, she said: \"I'm not that concerned about the ability of the young generation to be able to have the right skills for that.\"  Meanwhile, blue-collar jobs do appear to be   — those born between 1997 and 2012 — in part because of the high cost of getting a bachelor's degree in the U.S. CNBC Make It calculations in 2025 indicated that the annual cost of attending a four-year, in-state public college increased by about 30% between 2011 and 2023. \"There are about 2 million fewer students in a traditional four-year university now than in 2011,\"  , senior economist at payroll and benefits platform Gusto, told CNBC Make It at the time.

                "full_text": "In this article When   agreed to spend a reported $2 billion on   at the end of last year, the social media giant said it planned to take the startup's subscription AI agent offering and \"scale this service to many more businesses.\" But some existing Manus customers aren't thrilled with the deal and say they're now going elsewhere, the latest sign of skepticism toward Meta as it tries to compete with the likes of OpenAI,   and Anthropic in the booming artificial intelligence market.  Manus, a developer of general purpose AI agents, was founded in China in 2022 before relocating to Singapore. Last year, the company launched its first general AI agent, which can be customized to execute complex tasks such as market research, coding and data analysis.  Seth Dobrin, co-founder and CEO of Arya Labs, said Manus was his favorite agentic AI platform, but his company, which develops a type of so-called world models, is no longer using it under Meta's ownership. Dobrin told CNBC that while he had confidence in Manus' transparent terms of service, he doesn't have that level of trust in Meta and is \"legitimately sad that this has happened.\" \"I do not agree with a lot of Meta's practices around data and how they essentially weaponize people's personal data against them,\" said Dobrin, who helped launch Arya last year. \"I don't want to engage with a company who I don't feel comfortable with how they're going to use data.\" Meta, which gets almost all of its $200 billion in annualized revenue from ads,   on Dec. 29, that its purchase of Manus was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.  Manus said in a   on the day of the deal that it had reached millions of paying customers and a revenue run rate of more than $125 million. \"Our top priority is ensuring that this change won't be disruptive for our customers,\"  Manus said. \"We will continue to sell and operate our product subscription service through our app and website. The company will continue to operate from Singapore.\" Despite those assurances, Dobrin isn't alone in his concern. Karl Yeh, co-founder of consulting firm  , which advises startups on how to integrate AI tools, said he stopped using Manus at his company and has advised his clients to follow suit.  \"Will the data policies of Meta apply to Manus? I would assume it will eventually,\" Yeh told CNBC. \"That was the concern we had and why we stopped recommending it to our clients.\" \"We don't know where Manus is going to fit into Meta's AI road map,\" Yeh said. \"We're not sure if Manus is going to still remain a separate company even though they said it would.\" Yeh said he's moving to services from a startup called Genspark or somewhere else where there's more certainty because, \"In terms of Meta, we're just not sure.\" Meta didn't provide a comment beyond pointing to the blog post, which notes that, \"We're excited to welcome the Manus team and help improve the lives of billions of people and millions of businesses with their technology.\" Meta has opened its wallets to try and win in AI, most notably   more than $14 billion in June to hire Scale AI's Alexandr Wang and a handful of his top engineers and researchers and secure a stake in his startup. But unlike AI model leaders OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, Meta has yet to land on a   in the market, particularly when it comes to competing in the enterprise.  Meta's stock is down 17% since CEO   said on the last   in October that AI costs will keep growing. Analysts anticipate 2026 spending on AI could top $100 billion. Meta is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results next week.  Flo Crivello, CEO of a Manus competitor, Lindy, said his company initially saw a bump in users after news of Meta's acquisition.  \"We think there was sort of a halo effect from the announcement,\" Crivello said. \"It raised awareness about this category of software and people started researching it.\"  Crivello, who previously spent almost five years at   and worked on acquisitions, said he thinks Meta's rationale is less about bringing in enterprise customers, and more targeted at serving small businesses, which have long been crucial to Meta's ad revenue.  Crivello said Manus is \"focused on very small business owners like independent contractors,\" and said it could take a while for Meta to figure out where it takes Manus from here.  \"The way these companies think of these acquisitions, they're acquiring the company for a specific, strategic reason — they just don't know precisely what the integration might look like yet,\" Crivello said. \"They cut a check, it's a new thing they add to the chess board and then they figure it out. And sometimes it takes them years to figure out what to do.\" Outside of advertising, Meta has struggled in several areas where it's tried to crack the enterprise. The company   in 2024 that it was shuttering its Workplace communication and productivity platform, two years after   its Portal video calling device.  Last week, Meta said it's sunsetting its   virtual reality app, part of a broader   from VR, which had been Zuckerberg's big focus area before AI took off.  Navrina Singh, founder and CEO of governance startup Credo AI, says she doesn't see Fortune 500 companies embracing Meta's tools.  \"Among large enterprises — particularly in highly regulated sectors like health care and financial services — many AI deployments today are built on models from providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic,\" Singh said. Then they're typically run through cloud platforms operated by   or  , \"where trust, security, and accountability requirements are well-established and prioritized,\" she said. One area where Meta is finding success in the business world is WhatsApp, the messaging platform it acquired for $19 billion in 2014. WhatsApp for Business has become a popular way for companies to interact with customers. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore, has projected WhatsApp could generate $40 billion in revenue by 2030.  \"Business messaging remains a significant opportunity for us,\" Meta CFO Susan Li said on the company's last earnings call. \"We're also making good progress on our business AI efforts, where we've been focused on building a turnkey AI that helps businesses generate leads and drive sales.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article China's technology giants are entering a new phase of the artificial intelligence race called 'agentic commerce,' as firms such as Alibaba and ByteDance race to turn chatbots into full-service shopping and payment tools. Alibaba last week  , allowing users to complete transactions directly within the interface, including ordering food and booking air tickets. The upgrade connects Qwen to Alibaba's broader e-commerce ecosystem, allowing users to compare tailored product recommendations from platforms such as Taobao or its travel site Fliggy, before finally completing payments through Alipay, all without leaving the chatbot. Previously, Qwen could make recommendations based on user-generated prompts, but users still had to manually navigate multiple platforms to make purchases. The update reflects a broader shift among some global artificial intelligence firms from a focus on foundational AI models to \"agentic AI\", which performs tasks on behalf of users with limited supervision. \"The agentic transformation of commercial services enables the maximal integration of user services [and] enhances user stickiness,\" said Shaochen Wang, a research analyst at Counterpoint Research, referring to stronger long-term user engagement. That allows companies to build a sustainable competitive advantage, often called a business moat, which helps protect profits from competitors, he added. While commercial applications for agentic AI are expected to range from autonomous driving to cybersecurity, e-commerce is emerging as one of its earliest and most pervasive use cases, with payment and tech giants in the U.S. also   in recent months. Within China, Alibaba is well-positioned to be a pioneer in agentic commerce due to its advanced large language model capabilities and its extensive e-commerce network covering clothing, food, housing, and transportation, Wang said. Alibaba's strategy could help it compete with rival super apps such as Tencent's WeChat — widely regarded as China's leading 'super app' — which combines messaging, payments, e-commerce and other services into a single platform used by over 1 billion users. Other Chinese firms are also moving quickly.  ByteDance in December upgraded its popular Doubao AI chatbot to autonomously handle tasks such as ticket bookings through integrations with e-commerce features on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. The upgraded Doubao model was introduced on a prototype smartphone developed by ZTE Corp  capable of performing tasks across a user's mobile device. However,   were later   after rivals raised privacy and security concerns. Meanwhile, Tencent President Martin Lau said during the company's   that AI agents could become core components of the WeChat ecosystem.  \"AI agents will be foundational to the evolution of super apps, with success depending on deep integration across payments, logistics, and social engagement,\" Charlie Dai, VP and principal analyst at Forrester, told CNBC. While Chinese firms like  ,   and ByteDance will compete to embed agents across their platforms, they all benefit from integrated ecosystems, rich behavioral data, and consumer familiarity with super apps, said Dai. Western companies, while leading in foundational AI models and global reach, face more fragmented data and stricter privacy regulations, slowing cross-service integration, he added. U.S. players pursuing agentic commerce include OpenAI, Perplexity, and  .   is also exploring ways to position itself as a \" \" between merchants, consumers and AI agents. \"China will prioritize domestic integration and strategic expansion in selected regions, while U.S. firms focus on global scalability and governance,\" Dai noted. Approximately half of all consumers already use AI when searching online, according to a  .  The report estimated that AI agents could generate more than $1 trillion in economic value for U.S. businesses by 2030 by streamlining important yet routine steps in consumer decision-making.",

                "full_text": "In this article The future of the   company – its iconic movie studio, HBO Max, and its cable networks, including CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery and HGTV – may come down to what European regulators think about  . That's a pretty crazy twist for a deal that will dictate the future of many valuable American sports rights – assets that, for the most part, have very little to do with Europe. A quick refresher: WBD owns many live U.S. sports rights, including those to March Madness, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, the French Open, AEW, the College Football Playoffs and others. But those rights wouldn't go to Netflix under   to sell some of its assets to the streaming giant. Netflix has agreed to pay $27.75 per share for the WBD movie studio and streaming business, but not the cable networks, which own the sports rights. If the deal is approved, those networks would get spun out into a separate publicly traded entity called Discovery Global, which would also own Bleacher Report, House of Highlights and WBD's other digital assets. If WBD shareholders accept a   from  , however – and if that deal is approved – the cable networks and associated sports would all fall under the Paramount umbrella. Paramount has bid $30 per share for the entirety of WBD – an offer it has taken directly to shareholders after the WBD board rejected it. Paramount on Thursday   on its tender offer — which expired Wednesday — giving WBD shareholders more time to weigh the option.  WBD responded with a statement, noting that less than 7% of all shareholders have tendered their shares thus far to Paramount. \"Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. It's also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount's inferior scheme,\" WBD said. \"We are confident in our ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Netflix merger and look forward to delivering the tremendous and certain value our agreement will provide to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.\" Most media attention has focused on what U.S. President Donald Trump   a Netflix-WBD deal. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Trump ahead of the deal to gauge his sentiment on a transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice — theoretically an independent body from the presidency – will ultimately decide whether or not the deal presents antitrust problems, and if those issues can be ameliorated with conditions or if they're simply too big for a deal to go through. There's been far less attention paid to Europe, which will also need to approve a deal. And that's where either deal could fall apart.  Netflix is a global company, generating about $14.5 billion in revenue in its \"EMEA\" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region last year, or about 32% of total sales.  WBD feels confident its Netflix deal will win EU approval, according to people familiar with the matter. A WBD source said there was a \"95% certainty\" that Europe would approve the transaction, though the person did acknowledge Netflix may need to agree to certain conditions, such as agreeing to produce a certain amount of local content in Europe and promising to release movies into theaters. The EU's   already mandates that video-on-demand streaming services ensure at least 30% of programming in EU countries qualify as European works.  Paramount disagrees and believes a Netflix deal has very little chance of making it past European regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. At the same time, it's working its own EU regulatory angles for its proposed takeover. It would be unusual but not unprecedented for European regulators to block a deal between two U.S.-based companies.     $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma in December 2023 after deciding there was \"no clear path\" to gaining antitrust approval in Europe and the U.K. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority     Facebook to sell Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks, in 2022. The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. . It's also worth noting the European Commission allowed Amazon to acquire MGM, perhaps the closest comparison in terms of comparative businesses to this deal. Paramount's confidence stems from the continent's track record of being tough on tech companies, with antitrust crackdowns and penalties   Meta,  ,     and Amazon in recent years. Paramount executives believe EU regulators view Netflix similarly, based on recent conversations they've had with European officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Given the chance to stop a Big Tech company from gaining even more market power, Paramount executives believe Europe will take it. The EU may also be more parochial in how it treats movie theater owners, viewing them as essential to culture and art. Both U.S. and European trade associations for the cinema industry have   their   with a Netflix-Warner combination. This week, Sarandos reiterated that Warner Bros. films will be released in theaters with a 45-day window — as they always have. \"We're working closely with WBD and the regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals,\" Sarandos said Tuesday during   \"When this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled, world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. And we're excited to maintain it and further strengthen that business.\" The WBD board viewed two movie studios coming together – Paramount and Warner – as a bigger regulatory hurdle than any issue presented by Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, WBD's lawyers have determined both deals – Netflix-WBD and Paramount-WBD – would likely gain approval. \"The WBD Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the [Paramount tender] Offer with its regulatory advisors,\" WBD said in a December corporate filing. \"The WBD Board is of the view that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material.\" On the movie theater issue, a Warner source told me WBD actually views Paramount as a potentially bigger issue than Netflix. That's because WBD's board and executives aren't sure Paramount will have the money to produce 30 or more movies a year (a Paramount CEO David Ellison  ) while also paying down billions of dollars in debt and targeting $6 billion in cost savings.  This is why the structure of the Paramount deal is so important to WBD. To create a superior deal for WBD, Larry Ellison, David's father and one of the world's wealthiest men, would need to put up more money in equity to lower the leverage ratio of a combined company. The board doesn't trust Paramount can deliver on its synergies while also meeting its aggressive theatrical goals and moving forward with a leverage ratio over 7-times estimated 2026 EBITDA. This week, Netflix changed its offer for WBD's assets from mostly cash to  . Simplifying the bid allows WBD to move its shareholder meeting to approve the Netflix offer earlier – possibly as early as March, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount is still considering if it wants to raise its bid or change the capital structure to re-engage the WBD board, according to people familiar with the matter. It could also do nothing and wait to see if it's right about regulators – either European or American – blocking a Netflix deal. With so much attention on the importance of live sports to the TV industry, it's unusual to see them as such an afterthought. Paramount executives have argued the value of Discovery Global should be $0 based on its high leverage ratio and the early valuation of Versant, the parent company of CNBC, which has traded down almost 30% since it debuted on the public markets this month. In a   released Tuesday, WBD argued Discovery Global should be valued between $1.33 per share and $6.86 per share, depending on estimates.",

                "full_text": "In this article  on Wednesday rolled out an     assistant for members of its primary care chain One Medical, joining the likes of   and  , which recently launched similar features. The tool, called Health AI, uses large language models from Amazon's Bedrock service to answer questions and provide members with personalized advice based on their medical records, lab results and current medications.  It can also assist with managing medications and book appointments with a user's One Medical provider.  The tool pulls answers from a variety of sources, including licensed and proprietary data, knowledge verified by medical experts and in some cases, publicly-available data, Amazon said. Health AI appears in the app for One Medical, the health-care company Amazon acquired for   in 2023. One Medical runs brick-and-mortar clinics and also offers some telehealth services to members who pay between $99 and $199 a year for its services. Amazon said Health AI isn't intended to provide diagnosis or treatment, and it shouldn't replace a doctor's visit. The tool is \"programmed with clinical protocols\" that identify when symptoms or conditions require escalation to a provider or for an in-person visit, the company said. Conversations with Health AI also aren't added to a patient's medical records, Amazon said.  The company   Health AI among a subset of One Medical members last Spring before rolling out the tool more broadly. Other AI providers have also jumped into the lucrative health-care market.  Earlier this month, OpenAI launched  , a feature within its chatbot that enables users to upload medical records and receive personalized advice. Anthropic released its   feature shortly after.  Amazon said Health AI is easier for patients to use because it doesn't require them to upload documents or connect outside apps, and it's \"more actionable\" compared to other offerings. \"In short: other AI health chatbots provide general health information,\" Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, told CNBC in a statement. \"One Medical's Health AI assistant knows your health story, can take actions based on a patient's request, and keeps your trusted providers in the lead. It's the difference between getting answers and getting care.\" Amazon has   into health-care over the past decade. In addition to acquiring One Medical, Amazon also bought online pharmacy PillPack for about $750 million in 2018. Two years later, it launched its own offering called  . The company said Health AI may direct users to One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy services \"where it is helpful,\" but protected health information isn't used to market or advertise general merchandise from its broader webstore.",

                "full_text": "In this article The future of the   company – its iconic movie studio, HBO Max, and its cable networks, including CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery and HGTV – may come down to what European regulators think about  . That's a pretty crazy twist for a deal that will dictate the future of many valuable American sports rights – assets that, for the most part, have very little to do with Europe. A quick refresher: WBD owns many live U.S. sports rights, including those to March Madness, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, the French Open, AEW, the College Football Playoffs and others. But those rights wouldn't go to Netflix under   to sell some of its assets to the streaming giant. Netflix has agreed to pay $27.75 per share for the WBD movie studio and streaming business, but not the cable networks, which own the sports rights. If the deal is approved, those networks would get spun out into a separate publicly traded entity called Discovery Global, which would also own Bleacher Report, House of Highlights and WBD's other digital assets. If WBD shareholders accept a   from  , however – and if that deal is approved – the cable networks and associated sports would all fall under the Paramount umbrella. Paramount has bid $30 per share for the entirety of WBD – an offer it has taken directly to shareholders after the WBD board rejected it. Paramount on Thursday   on its tender offer — which expired Wednesday — giving WBD shareholders more time to weigh the option.  WBD responded with a statement, noting that less than 7% of all shareholders have tendered their shares thus far to Paramount. \"Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. It's also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount's inferior scheme,\" WBD said. \"We are confident in our ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Netflix merger and look forward to delivering the tremendous and certain value our agreement will provide to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.\" Most media attention has focused on what U.S. President Donald Trump   a Netflix-WBD deal. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Trump ahead of the deal to gauge his sentiment on a transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice — theoretically an independent body from the presidency – will ultimately decide whether or not the deal presents antitrust problems, and if those issues can be ameliorated with conditions or if they're simply too big for a deal to go through. There's been far less attention paid to Europe, which will also need to approve a deal. And that's where either deal could fall apart.  Netflix is a global company, generating about $14.5 billion in revenue in its \"EMEA\" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region last year, or about 32% of total sales.  WBD feels confident its Netflix deal will win EU approval, according to people familiar with the matter. A WBD source said there was a \"95% certainty\" that Europe would approve the transaction, though the person did acknowledge Netflix may need to agree to certain conditions, such as agreeing to produce a certain amount of local content in Europe and promising to release movies into theaters. The EU's   already mandates that video-on-demand streaming services ensure at least 30% of programming in EU countries qualify as European works.  Paramount disagrees and believes a Netflix deal has very little chance of making it past European regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. At the same time, it's working its own EU regulatory angles for its proposed takeover. It would be unusual but not unprecedented for European regulators to block a deal between two U.S.-based companies.     $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma in December 2023 after deciding there was \"no clear path\" to gaining antitrust approval in Europe and the U.K. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority     Facebook to sell Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks, in 2022. The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. . It's also worth noting the European Commission allowed Amazon to acquire MGM, perhaps the closest comparison in terms of comparative businesses to this deal. Paramount's confidence stems from the continent's track record of being tough on tech companies, with antitrust crackdowns and penalties   Meta,  ,     and Amazon in recent years. Paramount executives believe EU regulators view Netflix similarly, based on recent conversations they've had with European officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Given the chance to stop a Big Tech company from gaining even more market power, Paramount executives believe Europe will take it. The EU may also be more parochial in how it treats movie theater owners, viewing them as essential to culture and art. Both U.S. and European trade associations for the cinema industry have   their   with a Netflix-Warner combination. This week, Sarandos reiterated that Warner Bros. films will be released in theaters with a 45-day window — as they always have. \"We're working closely with WBD and the regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals,\" Sarandos said Tuesday during   \"When this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled, world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. And we're excited to maintain it and further strengthen that business.\" The WBD board viewed two movie studios coming together – Paramount and Warner – as a bigger regulatory hurdle than any issue presented by Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, WBD's lawyers have determined both deals – Netflix-WBD and Paramount-WBD – would likely gain approval. \"The WBD Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the [Paramount tender] Offer with its regulatory advisors,\" WBD said in a December corporate filing. \"The WBD Board is of the view that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material.\" On the movie theater issue, a Warner source told me WBD actually views Paramount as a potentially bigger issue than Netflix. That's because WBD's board and executives aren't sure Paramount will have the money to produce 30 or more movies a year (a Paramount CEO David Ellison  ) while also paying down billions of dollars in debt and targeting $6 billion in cost savings.  This is why the structure of the Paramount deal is so important to WBD. To create a superior deal for WBD, Larry Ellison, David's father and one of the world's wealthiest men, would need to put up more money in equity to lower the leverage ratio of a combined company. The board doesn't trust Paramount can deliver on its synergies while also meeting its aggressive theatrical goals and moving forward with a leverage ratio over 7-times estimated 2026 EBITDA. This week, Netflix changed its offer for WBD's assets from mostly cash to  . Simplifying the bid allows WBD to move its shareholder meeting to approve the Netflix offer earlier – possibly as early as March, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount is still considering if it wants to raise its bid or change the capital structure to re-engage the WBD board, according to people familiar with the matter. It could also do nothing and wait to see if it's right about regulators – either European or American – blocking a Netflix deal. With so much attention on the importance of live sports to the TV industry, it's unusual to see them as such an afterthought. Paramount executives have argued the value of Discovery Global should be $0 based on its high leverage ratio and the early valuation of Versant, the parent company of CNBC, which has traded down almost 30% since it debuted on the public markets this month. In a   released Tuesday, WBD argued Discovery Global should be valued between $1.33 per share and $6.86 per share, depending on estimates.",

Stocks were already rising after the U.S. president earlier said in a speech at the   in Davos, Switzerland, that he would not move to acquire Greenland by force. The S&P 500 ended the day up more than 1%, and the 30-stock Dow surged almost 600 points, or more than 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also advanced more than 1%. The   index of small-cap stocks gained about 2% and notched a record close. \"The Greenland crisis appears to be defusing and reversing the recent sell-off, although details are still forthcoming around the 'framework,'\" said Eric Teal, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management. He said that the relief rally sparked significant gains in traditional value sectors such as financials and energy stocks.

Analyst Brad Reback expects Datadog to post better-than-expected earnings next month. He sees the company reporting more than 23% growth. Shares were up 6% in morning trading Thursday. Last quarter, Datadog beat analyst expectations and grew revenue 28% year over year. While competition and acquisitions in the cloud platform space have caused concerns among analysts, Reback remains optimistic. \"While Palo's acquisition of Chronosphere and Snowflake's recent acquisition of Observe play into the negative narrative around the crowding in the observability space and that pricing will continue to broadly compress, given the time it will take to integrate these acquisitions into their respective organizations as well as the time to adapt to the new GTM strategy/buyer, we believe the near-term impact on Datadog's growth rate should be limited,\" Reback wrote.  \"Over the medium term, we note that DDOG has effectively worked with customers to ensure value based pricing and we think the platforms overall ease of use should enable the company to at least sustain current growth rates,\" he added.  —  The three leading U.S. indexes began Thursday's session in positive territory.

The uptick reflected higher revisions in consumer spending, exports, government and investment. Also, imports decreased amid the ongoing global tariff skirmish between the U.S. and its trading partners. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity, rose at a 3.5% rate for the quarter. Final sales to domestic purchasers, a proxy for demand across the $31 trillion economy, accelerated at a 6.3% rate, the highest since Q3 of 2023.

The EU has  in response to Trump announcing plans to impose 10% tariffs on six EU nations, alongside the U.K. and Norway from Feb. 1 on Saturday. There were calls for the bloc to consider using its anti-coercion instrument (ACI), a set of measures that allow it to impose sweeping trade sanctions, before Trump announced a   on Wednesday evening. \"All EU trade defense instruments — including the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI) — must now be reviewed,\" Volker Treier, chief executive of foreign trade at the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHK), which represents nearly 4 million businesses, told CNBC on Wednesday afternoon. He added that the ACI should be a \"last resort.\"  .  European stocks advanced on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump said a \"framework\" agreement had been reached over Greenland, and called off imposing escalating tariffs on a group of European countries. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was 1.13% higher shortly after the opening bell in London. GameStop CEO and chairman Ryan Cohen snapped up more of the video game retailer's shares, according to a Wednesday regulatory filing. The executive bought 500,000 shares at a weighted average price of $21.60 each on Wednesday, according   with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That's in addition to a purchase of 500,000 shares  . In this latest SEC filing, Cohen said it is \"essential\" for the CEO of a public company to purchase that company's shares with his or her own personal funds \"in order to strengthen alignment with stockholders.\" CEOs who fail to do so \"should be fired,\" the filing went on. Shares rose about 3% in extended trading. Investors are piling into   ahead of the chipmaker's quarterly earnings report scheduled for after Thursday's market close. The stock jumped more than 11% on Wednesday, touching its  . Much of the bullish sentiment is driven by enthusiasm on Intel's latest server chips, as well as investments last year from   and   into Intel. Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius Research, wrote in a note to clients that Intel's strong performance could signal more value ahead for its foundry business. \"Since Lip-Bu Tan was announced as CEO, shares of Intel have risen about 160%, with most of that performance coming since September when shortages started to become a big thing. Intel has the backing of Nvidia and the U.S. Government, who both look very smart right now. Intel is also now part of the vast 'shortage cohort' along with  ,   and other rocket ships ... Surging data center capex is driving up demand for Intel's server CPUs and advanced packaging assets for chips,\" Reitzes wrote. \"There is another issue reverberating throughout 'the shortage world,' specific to Intel but forgotten by haters. The more TSMC raises prices and is forced to give Nvidia and Broadcom huge AI chip allocations, the more an elephant like Apple will be forced to engage with Intel for its Foundry,\" he added Shares of   dropped 3.5% after the company issued disappointing first-quarter guidance. The truckload carrier sees first quarter adjusted earnings landing between 28 cents to 32 cents per share, compared to the FactSet consensus call for 31 cents a share. Fourth-quarter results also missed the mark on the top and bottom lines. Knight-Swift reported adjusted earnings of 31 cents per share on revenue of $1.86 billion, while analysts polled by LSEG expected earnings of 36 cents per share on $1.9 billion in revenue.

                "full_text": "In this article When   agreed to spend a reported $2 billion on   at the end of last year, the social media giant said it planned to take the startup's subscription AI agent offering and \"scale this service to many more businesses.\" But some existing Manus customers aren't thrilled with the deal and say they're now going elsewhere, the latest sign of skepticism toward Meta as it tries to compete with the likes of OpenAI,   and Anthropic in the booming artificial intelligence market.  Manus, a developer of general purpose AI agents, was founded in China in 2022 before relocating to Singapore. Last year, the company launched its first general AI agent, which can be customized to execute complex tasks such as market research, coding and data analysis.  Seth Dobrin, co-founder and CEO of Arya Labs, said Manus was his favorite agentic AI platform, but his company, which develops a type of so-called world models, is no longer using it under Meta's ownership. Dobrin told CNBC that while he had confidence in Manus' transparent terms of service, he doesn't have that level of trust in Meta and is \"legitimately sad that this has happened.\" \"I do not agree with a lot of Meta's practices around data and how they essentially weaponize people's personal data against them,\" said Dobrin, who helped launch Arya last year. \"I don't want to engage with a company who I don't feel comfortable with how they're going to use data.\" Meta, which gets almost all of its $200 billion in annualized revenue from ads,   on Dec. 29, that its purchase of Manus was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.  Manus said in a   on the day of the deal that it had reached millions of paying customers and a revenue run rate of more than $125 million. \"Our top priority is ensuring that this change won't be disruptive for our customers,\"  Manus said. \"We will continue to sell and operate our product subscription service through our app and website. The company will continue to operate from Singapore.\" Despite those assurances, Dobrin isn't alone in his concern. Karl Yeh, co-founder of consulting firm  , which advises startups on how to integrate AI tools, said he stopped using Manus at his company and has advised his clients to follow suit.  \"Will the data policies of Meta apply to Manus? I would assume it will eventually,\" Yeh told CNBC. \"That was the concern we had and why we stopped recommending it to our clients.\" \"We don't know where Manus is going to fit into Meta's AI road map,\" Yeh said. \"We're not sure if Manus is going to still remain a separate company even though they said it would.\" Yeh said he's moving to services from a startup called Genspark or somewhere else where there's more certainty because, \"In terms of Meta, we're just not sure.\" Meta didn't provide a comment beyond pointing to the blog post, which notes that, \"We're excited to welcome the Manus team and help improve the lives of billions of people and millions of businesses with their technology.\" Meta has opened its wallets to try and win in AI, most notably   more than $14 billion in June to hire Scale AI's Alexandr Wang and a handful of his top engineers and researchers and secure a stake in his startup. But unlike AI model leaders OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, Meta has yet to land on a   in the market, particularly when it comes to competing in the enterprise.  Meta's stock is down 17% since CEO   said on the last   in October that AI costs will keep growing. Analysts anticipate 2026 spending on AI could top $100 billion. Meta is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results next week.  Flo Crivello, CEO of a Manus competitor, Lindy, said his company initially saw a bump in users after news of Meta's acquisition.  \"We think there was sort of a halo effect from the announcement,\" Crivello said. \"It raised awareness about this category of software and people started researching it.\"  Crivello, who previously spent almost five years at   and worked on acquisitions, said he thinks Meta's rationale is less about bringing in enterprise customers, and more targeted at serving small businesses, which have long been crucial to Meta's ad revenue.  Crivello said Manus is \"focused on very small business owners like independent contractors,\" and said it could take a while for Meta to figure out where it takes Manus from here.  \"The way these companies think of these acquisitions, they're acquiring the company for a specific, strategic reason — they just don't know precisely what the integration might look like yet,\" Crivello said. \"They cut a check, it's a new thing they add to the chess board and then they figure it out. And sometimes it takes them years to figure out what to do.\" Outside of advertising, Meta has struggled in several areas where it's tried to crack the enterprise. The company   in 2024 that it was shuttering its Workplace communication and productivity platform, two years after   its Portal video calling device.  Last week, Meta said it's sunsetting its   virtual reality app, part of a broader   from VR, which had been Zuckerberg's big focus area before AI took off.  Navrina Singh, founder and CEO of governance startup Credo AI, says she doesn't see Fortune 500 companies embracing Meta's tools.  \"Among large enterprises — particularly in highly regulated sectors like health care and financial services — many AI deployments today are built on models from providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic,\" Singh said. Then they're typically run through cloud platforms operated by   or  , \"where trust, security, and accountability requirements are well-established and prioritized,\" she said. One area where Meta is finding success in the business world is WhatsApp, the messaging platform it acquired for $19 billion in 2014. WhatsApp for Business has become a popular way for companies to interact with customers. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore, has projected WhatsApp could generate $40 billion in revenue by 2030.  \"Business messaging remains a significant opportunity for us,\" Meta CFO Susan Li said on the company's last earnings call. \"We're also making good progress on our business AI efforts, where we've been focused on building a turnkey AI that helps businesses generate leads and drive sales.\"",

That's a pretty crazy twist for a deal that will dictate the future of many valuable American sports rights – assets that, for the most part, have very little to do with Europe. A quick refresher: WBD owns many live U.S. sports rights, including those to March Madness, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, the French Open, AEW, the College Football Playoffs and others. But those rights wouldn't go to Netflix under   to sell some of its assets to the streaming giant. Netflix has agreed to pay $27.75 per share for the WBD movie studio and streaming business, but not the cable networks, which own the sports rights. If the deal is approved, those networks would get spun out into a separate publicly traded entity called Discovery Global, which would also own Bleacher Report, House of Highlights and WBD's other digital assets. If WBD shareholders accept a   from  , however – and if that deal is approved – the cable networks and associated sports would all fall under the Paramount umbrella. Paramount has bid $30 per share for the entirety of WBD – an offer it has taken directly to shareholders after the WBD board rejected it. Paramount on Thursday   on its tender offer — which expired Wednesday — giving WBD shareholders more time to weigh the option.  WBD responded with a statement, noting that less than 7% of all shareholders have tendered their shares thus far to Paramount. \"Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. It's also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount's inferior scheme,\" WBD said. \"We are confident in our ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Netflix merger and look forward to delivering the tremendous and certain value our agreement will provide to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.\" Most media attention has focused on what U.S. President Donald Trump   a Netflix-WBD deal. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Trump ahead of the deal to gauge his sentiment on a transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice — theoretically an independent body from the presidency – will ultimately decide whether or not the deal presents antitrust problems, and if those issues can be ameliorated with conditions or if they're simply too big for a deal to go through. There's been far less attention paid to Europe, which will also need to approve a deal. And that's where either deal could fall apart.  Netflix is a global company, generating about $14.5 billion in revenue in its \"EMEA\" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region last year, or about 32% of total sales.  WBD feels confident its Netflix deal will win EU approval, according to people familiar with the matter. A WBD source said there was a \"95% certainty\" that Europe would approve the transaction, though the person did acknowledge Netflix may need to agree to certain conditions, such as agreeing to produce a certain amount of local content in Europe and promising to release movies into theaters. The EU's   already mandates that video-on-demand streaming services ensure at least 30% of programming in EU countries qualify as European works.  Paramount disagrees and believes a Netflix deal has very little chance of making it past European regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. At the same time, it's working its own EU regulatory angles for its proposed takeover. It would be unusual but not unprecedented for European regulators to block a deal between two U.S.-based companies.     $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma in December 2023 after deciding there was \"no clear path\" to gaining antitrust approval in Europe and the U.K. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority     Facebook to sell Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks, in 2022. The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. . It's also worth noting the European Commission allowed Amazon to acquire MGM, perhaps the closest comparison in terms of comparative businesses to this deal. Paramount's confidence stems from the continent's track record of being tough on tech companies, with antitrust crackdowns and penalties   Meta,  ,     and Amazon in recent years. Paramount executives believe EU regulators view Netflix similarly, based on recent conversations they've had with European officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Given the chance to stop a Big Tech company from gaining even more market power, Paramount executives believe Europe will take it. The EU may also be more parochial in how it treats movie theater owners, viewing them as essential to culture and art. Both U.S. and European trade associations for the cinema industry have   their   with a Netflix-Warner combination. This week, Sarandos reiterated that Warner Bros. films will be released in theaters with a 45-day window — as they always have. \"We're working closely with WBD and the regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals,\" Sarandos said Tuesday during   \"When this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled, world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. And we're excited to maintain it and further strengthen that business.\" The WBD board viewed two movie studios coming together – Paramount and Warner – as a bigger regulatory hurdle than any issue presented by Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, WBD's lawyers have determined both deals – Netflix-WBD and Paramount-WBD – would likely gain approval. \"The WBD Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the [Paramount tender] Offer with its regulatory advisors,\" WBD said in a December corporate filing. \"The WBD Board is of the view that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material.\" On the movie theater issue, a Warner source told me WBD actually views Paramount as a potentially bigger issue than Netflix. That's because WBD's board and executives aren't sure Paramount will have the money to produce 30 or more movies a year (a Paramount CEO David Ellison  ) while also paying down billions of dollars in debt and targeting $6 billion in cost savings.  This is why the structure of the Paramount deal is so important to WBD. To create a superior deal for WBD, Larry Ellison, David's father and one of the world's wealthiest men, would need to put up more money in equity to lower the leverage ratio of a combined company. The board doesn't trust Paramount can deliver on its synergies while also meeting its aggressive theatrical goals and moving forward with a leverage ratio over 7-times estimated 2026 EBITDA. This week, Netflix changed its offer for WBD's assets from mostly cash to  . Simplifying the bid allows WBD to move its shareholder meeting to approve the Netflix offer earlier – possibly as early as March, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount is still considering if it wants to raise its bid or change the capital structure to re-engage the WBD board, according to people familiar with the matter. It could also do nothing and wait to see if it's right about regulators – either European or American – blocking a Netflix deal. With so much attention on the importance of live sports to the TV industry, it's unusual to see them as such an afterthought. Paramount executives have argued the value of Discovery Global should be $0 based on its high leverage ratio and the early valuation of Versant, the parent company of CNBC, which has traded down almost 30% since it debuted on the public markets this month.

                "full_text": "In this article  chief Jensen Huang said that AI robotics is a \"once-in-a-generation\" opportunity for Europe as the region boasts an industrial manufacturing base that is \"incredibly strong.\" \"You can now fuse your industrial capability, your manufacturing capability, with artificial intelligence, and that brings you into the world of physical AI, or robotics,\" he said in an address at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday.  It presents an opportunity to \"leap past\" the era of software, he added, which has been led by the U.S. Attention across the industrial and tech sectors has increasingly shifted to autonomous robotics as recent advances in AI promise more capabilities.  European industrial and manufacturing giants, including  ,  ,   and  , have all announced robotics projects and partnerships with robotics tech companies in the past year.  Big Tech companies have also been doubling down in the space.   CEO Elon Musk said 80% of the company's value would come from its   in September,   AI division DeepMind released AI models for robotics in 2025, and Nvidia announced partnerships with Alphabet to work on physical AI in March. Tech investors have taken note. Companies building robotics raised a record $26.5 billion in 2025, according to deal counting platform Dealroom. To take advantage of the opportunity in AI, Europe has to \"get serious\" about its energy supply so that it can invest in the infrastructure layer, Huang said.  The region has some of the highest energy costs in the world. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said energy costs will be a key factor in determining how successful countries are in the   at WEF on Tuesday. \"I think that it's fairly certain that you have to get serious about increasing your energy supply so that you could invest in the infrastructure layer, so that you could have a rich ecosystem of artificial intelligence here in Europe,\" Huang said. Europe has been grappling with   as hyperscalers look to roll out AI infrastructure across the region.  That rapid buildout is showing no signs of slowing down, said Huang. AI has started the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" he told the audience at WEF. \"We're now a few hundred billion dollars into it. There are trillions of dollars of infrastructure that needs to be built out.\"",

Miami is the sixth market where Waymo offers driverless ride-hailing service, extending its lead over   and  -owned Zoox. As U.S. competition has lagged, Waymo's planned 2026 expansions could lock in rider demand and loyalty in the U.S. To start, Waymo will offer its services within a 60-square-mile area that includes Miami's Design District, Wynwood, Brickell and Coral Gables neighborhoods, the  .

Hassett had been   to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May, but prediction markets showed former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh moved ahead in the race following the president's remarks. Traders see Hassett as the more market-friendly option to replace Powell, with Wall Street expecting him to be more willing than Warsh to keep rates low. \"Whether it's Hassett or someone else, I think the assumption that we — at least most of us — have is that whoever it's going to be, this person is going to certainly have a political motive and not the more traditional, trying-to-be-fully-objective mindset in regards to leading the Fed,\" said David Krakauer, vice president of portfolio management at Mercer Advisors. \"That threat to the independence of the Fed is certainly, you know, a concern for us and everyone.\" The major averages are coming off a winning session thanks to gains in chip stocks.   led the advance after a blowout fourth-quarter report.

Analyst Eugene Hsiao upgraded Nio to outperform from neutral in a Friday note to clients, citing the company's Battery-as-a-Service as a key differentiator, with more than 80% of customers opting to lease the battery rather than purchase it outright. This model means rising lithium costs could have a lower direct impact on margins for Nio, Hsiao said.  \"Volumes remain challenging, but we think NIO is at a point where high upfront spending on battery swapping and service centers provides an edge. A unique BaaS offering provides a strong alternative to traditional EV ownership; rising Onvo sales could provide a lifeline,\" the analyst wrote.

Montani said that his conviction in Dollar Tree's ability to execute rose following an Orlando store tour and deep dive with CFO Steward Glendinning. \"We see Dollar Tree's multi-price point merchandising strategy as a way to drive newness and relevance in its assortment.

Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman on Friday indicated that there is room ahead for more interest rate cuts as the central bank should prioritize getting ahead of potential weakness in the labor market. Speaking at an economic forum in Foxborough,  Mass., the policymaker advocated a forward-looking approach based on \"informed\" forecasts rather than the solely data-dependent policy many of her fellow officials back. \"Absent a clear and sustained improvement in labor market conditions, we should remain ready to adjust policy to bring it closer to neutral,\" Bowman said. \"We should also avoid signaling that we will pause without identifying that conditions have changed. Doing so will indicate that we are not attentive or responsive to the recent and expected path of the labor market.\" The central bank official added that she sees inflation \"on a sustained trajectory\" to the Fed's 2% goal countered by \"growing labor market fragility\" that the Fed should head move to \"preemptively stabilize.\" Bowman is under consideration for to take over the chair position when Jerome Powell's term expires in May, though prediction markets rate her to be an extreme longshot. Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh on Friday vaulted to the front of the pack in the race for central bank chair following remarks from President Donald Trump, according to a closely watched prediction market. Traders on Kalshi pushed Warsh well ahead of the person seen as his closest competitor, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. In remarks delivered Friday morning, Trump, without explicitly stating his decision, said he'd prefer to keep Hassett in his position as top economic advisor. \"I see Kevin's in the audience, and I just want to thank you.

Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said Novo's weight loss pill accounted for about 1.3% of all Wegovy prescriptions in its very first week of launch.

Bank of America Securities downgraded   to underperform from neutral on Tuesday, saying it sees better opportunities elsewhere. ConocoPhillips's oil breakeven is $53 U.S. West Texas Intermediate, which is materially higher than other oil and gas names, analyst Kalei Akamine said in a note to clients. An oil breakeven price is essentially the minimum price a company needs to cover its costs. In addition, the company's debt-adjusted free cash flow yield is an uncompetitive 4.4%, he said.  \"These headwinds are being driven in part by long-cycle spending on Port Arthur LNG and Willow, with start-up still two and four years away, respectively,\" Akamine wrote. \"At our forecast of $57 WTI, we do not believe COP can sustain its recent pace of returning 45% of cash flow.\" At the same time, Akamine upgraded   to buy on the strength of its oil breakeven price of $37. He also said there is \"the potential for a stronger‑than‑expected oil guide driven by what we view as solid operating momentum exiting 4Q25.\" Akamine raised his price target to $28 from $26, implying 24.5%  upside from Thursday's close.

On Tuesday, the airline revised its earnings guidance to $6.50-$7.50 per share for 2026, or below the Street's consensus estimate of about $7.30, according to a Bank of America note to clients dated Friday.  However, analysts shook off the downward revision following a call with investors and Delta CFO Dan Janki this week. They stressed that the firm's strong cash generation and focus on premium travel are reasons to remain bullish on the stock.  \"The call reinforced our thesis that DAL is a key structural leader in the airline industry given its premium revenue focus, strong cash generation, low leverage, and diversified revenue streams (loyalty, MRO),\" analyst Andrew Didora said in the note.  He added that Delta \"remains positive on fundamentals,\" as its customers, particularly clients that opt for its premium services, prove resilient to rising macroeconomic volatility.  Here are some of the stocks moving before the bell:   — The biotech company rallied 22%, adding to a 30% rally in the previous session that was sparked by strong guidance for its bladder cancer drug Anktiva. ImmunityBio expects full-year revenue for the drug to jump 700%.  — Shares rose more than 3% after Deutsche Bank   to buy, saying most of the regulatory uncertainty has been priced in.  — The bank rose 3% after posting better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and promising guidance. PNC reported revenue of $5.96 billion versus an LSEG consensus estimate of $5.89 billion. Earnings of $4.88 per share also exceeded a forecast of $4.22 per share.

It presents an opportunity to \"leap past\" the era of software, he added, which has been led by the U.S. Attention across the industrial and tech sectors has increasingly shifted to autonomous robotics as recent advances in AI promise more capabilities.  European industrial and manufacturing giants, including  ,  ,   and  , have all announced robotics projects and partnerships with robotics tech companies in the past year.  Big Tech companies have also been doubling down in the space.   CEO Elon Musk said 80% of the company's value would come from its   in September,   AI division DeepMind released AI models for robotics in 2025, and Nvidia announced partnerships with Alphabet to work on physical AI in March. Tech investors have taken note. Companies building robotics raised a record $26.5 billion in 2025, according to deal counting platform Dealroom. To take advantage of the opportunity in AI, Europe has to \"get serious\" about its energy supply so that it can invest in the infrastructure layer, Huang said.  The region has some of the highest energy costs in the world. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said energy costs will be a key factor in determining how successful countries are in the   at WEF on Tuesday. \"I think that it's fairly certain that you have to get serious about increasing your energy supply so that you could invest in the infrastructure layer, so that you could have a rich ecosystem of artificial intelligence here in Europe,\" Huang said. Europe has been grappling with   as hyperscalers look to roll out AI infrastructure across the region.  That rapid buildout is showing no signs of slowing down, said Huang. AI has started the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" he told the audience at WEF. \"We're now a few hundred billion dollars into it. There are trillions of dollars of infrastructure that needs to be built out.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article When   agreed to spend a reported $2 billion on   at the end of last year, the social media giant said it planned to take the startup's subscription AI agent offering and \"scale this service to many more businesses.\" But some existing Manus customers aren't thrilled with the deal and say they're now going elsewhere, the latest sign of skepticism toward Meta as it tries to compete with the likes of OpenAI,   and Anthropic in the booming artificial intelligence market.  Manus, a developer of general purpose AI agents, was founded in China in 2022 before relocating to Singapore. Last year, the company launched its first general AI agent, which can be customized to execute complex tasks such as market research, coding and data analysis.  Seth Dobrin, co-founder and CEO of Arya Labs, said Manus was his favorite agentic AI platform, but his company, which develops a type of so-called world models, is no longer using it under Meta's ownership. Dobrin told CNBC that while he had confidence in Manus' transparent terms of service, he doesn't have that level of trust in Meta and is \"legitimately sad that this has happened.\" \"I do not agree with a lot of Meta's practices around data and how they essentially weaponize people's personal data against them,\" said Dobrin, who helped launch Arya last year. \"I don't want to engage with a company who I don't feel comfortable with how they're going to use data.\" Meta, which gets almost all of its $200 billion in annualized revenue from ads,   on Dec. 29, that its purchase of Manus was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.  Manus said in a   on the day of the deal that it had reached millions of paying customers and a revenue run rate of more than $125 million. \"Our top priority is ensuring that this change won't be disruptive for our customers,\"  Manus said. \"We will continue to sell and operate our product subscription service through our app and website. The company will continue to operate from Singapore.\" Despite those assurances, Dobrin isn't alone in his concern. Karl Yeh, co-founder of consulting firm  , which advises startups on how to integrate AI tools, said he stopped using Manus at his company and has advised his clients to follow suit.  \"Will the data policies of Meta apply to Manus? I would assume it will eventually,\" Yeh told CNBC. \"That was the concern we had and why we stopped recommending it to our clients.\" \"We don't know where Manus is going to fit into Meta's AI road map,\" Yeh said. \"We're not sure if Manus is going to still remain a separate company even though they said it would.\" Yeh said he's moving to services from a startup called Genspark or somewhere else where there's more certainty because, \"In terms of Meta, we're just not sure.\" Meta didn't provide a comment beyond pointing to the blog post, which notes that, \"We're excited to welcome the Manus team and help improve the lives of billions of people and millions of businesses with their technology.\" Meta has opened its wallets to try and win in AI, most notably   more than $14 billion in June to hire Scale AI's Alexandr Wang and a handful of his top engineers and researchers and secure a stake in his startup. But unlike AI model leaders OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, Meta has yet to land on a   in the market, particularly when it comes to competing in the enterprise.  Meta's stock is down 17% since CEO   said on the last   in October that AI costs will keep growing. Analysts anticipate 2026 spending on AI could top $100 billion. Meta is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results next week.  Flo Crivello, CEO of a Manus competitor, Lindy, said his company initially saw a bump in users after news of Meta's acquisition.  \"We think there was sort of a halo effect from the announcement,\" Crivello said. \"It raised awareness about this category of software and people started researching it.\"  Crivello, who previously spent almost five years at   and worked on acquisitions, said he thinks Meta's rationale is less about bringing in enterprise customers, and more targeted at serving small businesses, which have long been crucial to Meta's ad revenue.  Crivello said Manus is \"focused on very small business owners like independent contractors,\" and said it could take a while for Meta to figure out where it takes Manus from here.  \"The way these companies think of these acquisitions, they're acquiring the company for a specific, strategic reason — they just don't know precisely what the integration might look like yet,\" Crivello said. \"They cut a check, it's a new thing they add to the chess board and then they figure it out. And sometimes it takes them years to figure out what to do.\" Outside of advertising, Meta has struggled in several areas where it's tried to crack the enterprise. The company   in 2024 that it was shuttering its Workplace communication and productivity platform, two years after   its Portal video calling device.  Last week, Meta said it's sunsetting its   virtual reality app, part of a broader   from VR, which had been Zuckerberg's big focus area before AI took off.  Navrina Singh, founder and CEO of governance startup Credo AI, says she doesn't see Fortune 500 companies embracing Meta's tools.  \"Among large enterprises — particularly in highly regulated sectors like health care and financial services — many AI deployments today are built on models from providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic,\" Singh said. Then they're typically run through cloud platforms operated by   or  , \"where trust, security, and accountability requirements are well-established and prioritized,\" she said. One area where Meta is finding success in the business world is WhatsApp, the messaging platform it acquired for $19 billion in 2014. WhatsApp for Business has become a popular way for companies to interact with customers. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore, has projected WhatsApp could generate $40 billion in revenue by 2030.  \"Business messaging remains a significant opportunity for us,\" Meta CFO Susan Li said on the company's last earnings call. \"We're also making good progress on our business AI efforts, where we've been focused on building a turnkey AI that helps businesses generate leads and drive sales.\"",

But as one of the leading sources of user-generated content on the internet, YouTube is dealing with an explosion in the number of videos created by AI. The term AI slop   to the mass of low-quality AI content that's showing up across social media platforms. In addition to YouTube, companies such as   and TikTok rely on recommendation systems powered by AI that surface personalized videos designed to keep users engaged for longer periods of time. Mohan said the world is at an \"inflection point,\" where \"the lines between creativity and technology are blurring.\" \"To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we're actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content,\" Mohan wrote.  He said that YouTube clearly labels videos created by AI products and requires creators to disclose if they've produced altered content. The company's systems also remove \"harmful synthetic media\" that violates its guidelines, Mohan wrote.  Critical to YouTube's growth among users, creators and advertisers is keeping the platform desirable for all parties involved.  In December, YouTube said it would be   its \"likeness detection,\" which flags when a creator's face is used without their permission in deepfakes. The feature is being rolled out to millions of creators in the YouTube Partner Program. Mohan's letter said the company will use AI as a tool and \"not a replacement,\" adding that on average more than 1 million YouTube channels used its artificial intelligence creation technology daily in December. The company is expanding the way creators can take advantage of AI, he said, including on YouTube's short-form video offering called Shorts, which competes with TikTok and Instagram Reels.  \"This year you'll be able to create a Short using your own likeness, produce games with a simple text prompt, and experiment with music,\" he wrote.  Mohan described creators as \"the new stars and studios,\" and said YouTube creators are \"buying studio-sized lots in Hollywood and beyond to pioneer new formats and produce beautifully produced, must-see TV.\"  The company also wants to provide new ways for creators to earn, from \"shopping and brand deals to fan funding features like Jewels and gifts.\" Another priority, Mohan said, is making YouTube \"the best place for kids and teens\" and said this year the company plans to make it easier for parents to set up new kid accounts and to easily switch between them. YouTube   in September that it's paid out more than $100 billion to creators, artists and media companies since 2021. Earlier in the year, analysts at MoffettNathanson   that If it was a stand-alone business, YouTube would be worth between $475 billion and $550 billion.",

However, she stressed that sovereignty is non-negotiable. \"The Kingdom of Denmark wishes to continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with allies on how we can strengthen security in the Arctic, including the US's Golden Dome, provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity,\" Frederiksen said. Inflation drifted slightly further from the Federal Reserve's target in November though in line with expectations, according to the central bank's preferred gauge released Thursday. The personal consumption expenditures price index, a Commerce Department measure the central bank uses as its main forecasting tool, showed inflation at 2.8% for the month, in line with the Dow Jones consensus. In addition, the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the rate for October was 2.7% on both a headline and core basis, the latter excluding volatile food and energy prices.  . Stifel has a positive outlook on  . The bank upgraded the software company to buy from hold and lowered its price target to $160 from $205.The new estimate still implies 22% gains from Wednesday's close. Analyst Brad Reback expects Datadog to post better-than-expected earnings next month. He sees the company reporting more than 23% growth. Shares were up 6% in morning trading Thursday. Last quarter, Datadog beat analyst expectations and grew revenue 28% year over year. While competition and acquisitions in the cloud platform space have caused concerns among analysts, Reback remains optimistic. \"While Palo's acquisition of Chronosphere and Snowflake's recent acquisition of Observe play into the negative narrative around the crowding in the observability space and that pricing will continue to broadly compress, given the time it will take to integrate these acquisitions into their respective organizations as well as the time to adapt to the new GTM strategy/buyer, we believe the near-term impact on Datadog's growth rate should be limited,\" Reback wrote.  \"Over the medium term, we note that DDOG has effectively worked with customers to ensure value based pricing and we think the platforms overall ease of use should enable the company to at least sustain current growth rates,\" he added.  —  The three leading U.S. indexes began Thursday's session in positive territory. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% just after the opening bell, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 405 points, or 0.8%. To see other stocks making premarket moves,  . The U.S. economy expanded at a slightly faster than expected period in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.  rose at a 4.4% annualized pace for the July-through-September period, up 0.1 percentage point from the prior estimate and better than the 3.8% in the second quarter, according to numbers adjusted for seasonality and inflation. The uptick reflected higher revisions in consumer spending, exports, government and investment. Also, imports decreased amid the ongoing global tariff skirmish between the U.S. and its trading partners. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity, rose at a 3.5% rate for the quarter. Final sales to domestic purchasers, a proxy for demand across the $31 trillion economy, accelerated at a 6.3% rate, the highest since Q3 of 2023. The stellar year for U.S. growth is expected to continue through the fourth quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's   running tracker of incoming data is putting the Q4 figure at 5.4%. Initial jobless claims were little changed last week, continuing a low-layoff trend that is putting a floor under the labor market. First-time filings for unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 200,000 for the week ended Jan. 17, up 1,000 from the prior week and below the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 208,000, according to a Labor Department report Thursday. On a four-week moving basis, claims have averaged 201,500, the lowest since Jan. 13, 2024. Continuing claims, which run a week behind, edged lower to 1.85 million, down 26,000 from a week ago.

                "full_text": "In this article The future of the   company – its iconic movie studio, HBO Max, and its cable networks, including CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery and HGTV – may come down to what European regulators think about  . That's a pretty crazy twist for a deal that will dictate the future of many valuable American sports rights – assets that, for the most part, have very little to do with Europe. A quick refresher: WBD owns many live U.S. sports rights, including those to March Madness, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, the French Open, AEW, the College Football Playoffs and others. But those rights wouldn't go to Netflix under   to sell some of its assets to the streaming giant. Netflix has agreed to pay $27.75 per share for the WBD movie studio and streaming business, but not the cable networks, which own the sports rights. If the deal is approved, those networks would get spun out into a separate publicly traded entity called Discovery Global, which would also own Bleacher Report, House of Highlights and WBD's other digital assets. If WBD shareholders accept a   from  , however – and if that deal is approved – the cable networks and associated sports would all fall under the Paramount umbrella. Paramount has bid $30 per share for the entirety of WBD – an offer it has taken directly to shareholders after the WBD board rejected it. Paramount on Thursday   on its tender offer — which expired Wednesday — giving WBD shareholders more time to weigh the option.  WBD responded with a statement, noting that less than 7% of all shareholders have tendered their shares thus far to Paramount. \"Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. It's also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount's inferior scheme,\" WBD said. \"We are confident in our ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Netflix merger and look forward to delivering the tremendous and certain value our agreement will provide to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.\" Most media attention has focused on what U.S. President Donald Trump   a Netflix-WBD deal. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Trump ahead of the deal to gauge his sentiment on a transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice — theoretically an independent body from the presidency – will ultimately decide whether or not the deal presents antitrust problems, and if those issues can be ameliorated with conditions or if they're simply too big for a deal to go through. There's been far less attention paid to Europe, which will also need to approve a deal. And that's where either deal could fall apart.  Netflix is a global company, generating about $14.5 billion in revenue in its \"EMEA\" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region last year, or about 32% of total sales.  WBD feels confident its Netflix deal will win EU approval, according to people familiar with the matter. A WBD source said there was a \"95% certainty\" that Europe would approve the transaction, though the person did acknowledge Netflix may need to agree to certain conditions, such as agreeing to produce a certain amount of local content in Europe and promising to release movies into theaters. The EU's   already mandates that video-on-demand streaming services ensure at least 30% of programming in EU countries qualify as European works.  Paramount disagrees and believes a Netflix deal has very little chance of making it past European regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. At the same time, it's working its own EU regulatory angles for its proposed takeover. It would be unusual but not unprecedented for European regulators to block a deal between two U.S.-based companies.     $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma in December 2023 after deciding there was \"no clear path\" to gaining antitrust approval in Europe and the U.K. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority     Facebook to sell Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks, in 2022. The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. . It's also worth noting the European Commission allowed Amazon to acquire MGM, perhaps the closest comparison in terms of comparative businesses to this deal. Paramount's confidence stems from the continent's track record of being tough on tech companies, with antitrust crackdowns and penalties   Meta,  ,     and Amazon in recent years. Paramount executives believe EU regulators view Netflix similarly, based on recent conversations they've had with European officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Given the chance to stop a Big Tech company from gaining even more market power, Paramount executives believe Europe will take it. The EU may also be more parochial in how it treats movie theater owners, viewing them as essential to culture and art. Both U.S. and European trade associations for the cinema industry have   their   with a Netflix-Warner combination. This week, Sarandos reiterated that Warner Bros. films will be released in theaters with a 45-day window — as they always have. \"We're working closely with WBD and the regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals,\" Sarandos said Tuesday during   \"When this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled, world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. And we're excited to maintain it and further strengthen that business.\" The WBD board viewed two movie studios coming together – Paramount and Warner – as a bigger regulatory hurdle than any issue presented by Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, WBD's lawyers have determined both deals – Netflix-WBD and Paramount-WBD – would likely gain approval. \"The WBD Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the [Paramount tender] Offer with its regulatory advisors,\" WBD said in a December corporate filing. \"The WBD Board is of the view that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material.\" On the movie theater issue, a Warner source told me WBD actually views Paramount as a potentially bigger issue than Netflix. That's because WBD's board and executives aren't sure Paramount will have the money to produce 30 or more movies a year (a Paramount CEO David Ellison  ) while also paying down billions of dollars in debt and targeting $6 billion in cost savings.  This is why the structure of the Paramount deal is so important to WBD. To create a superior deal for WBD, Larry Ellison, David's father and one of the world's wealthiest men, would need to put up more money in equity to lower the leverage ratio of a combined company. The board doesn't trust Paramount can deliver on its synergies while also meeting its aggressive theatrical goals and moving forward with a leverage ratio over 7-times estimated 2026 EBITDA. This week, Netflix changed its offer for WBD's assets from mostly cash to  . Simplifying the bid allows WBD to move its shareholder meeting to approve the Netflix offer earlier – possibly as early as March, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount is still considering if it wants to raise its bid or change the capital structure to re-engage the WBD board, according to people familiar with the matter. It could also do nothing and wait to see if it's right about regulators – either European or American – blocking a Netflix deal. With so much attention on the importance of live sports to the TV industry, it's unusual to see them as such an afterthought. Paramount executives have argued the value of Discovery Global should be $0 based on its high leverage ratio and the early valuation of Versant, the parent company of CNBC, which has traded down almost 30% since it debuted on the public markets this month. In a   released Tuesday, WBD argued Discovery Global should be valued between $1.33 per share and $6.86 per share, depending on estimates.",

Huang, one of the foremost voices on artificial intelligence, struck an optimistic tone on its impact on the labor market in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos Wednesday.  \"This is the largest infrastructure build-out in human history that's going to create a lot of jobs,\" Huang said. \"It's wonderful that the jobs are related to trade craft, and we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steel workers, and network technicians, and people who install and fit out the equipment.\"  Huang added that he was seeing \"quite a significant boom\" in this area, with salaries nearly doubling.  \"And so we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories,\" he added.

Kristalina Georgieva, managing director at the International Monetary Fund, said Tuesday that AI is \"hitting the labor market like a tsunami, and most countries and most businesses are not prepared for it.\"  However,  found that blue-collar jobs were the least likely to be automated and hence safer from job cuts and layoffs. The roles named ranged from phlebotomists to helpers, painters, plasterers, and ship engineers.  The research, which analyzed data from 200,000 conversations with Microsoft Bing Copilot between January and September 2024, focused on how much users sought assistance from the chatbot to complete a task. Professionals who did physical work, whether with people or machines, were least likely to rely on AI.  \"Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don't need to have a PhD in computer science to do so,\" Huang said.  Roxana Mînzatu, EVP for social rights and skills, quality jobs, and preparedness at the European Commission, told CNBC in a conversation at WEF that young people should pursue vocational training in order to secure these blue-collar roles.  \"There are a lot of job offers in the vocational direction. I've had a discussion with the semiconductor industry, those that produce the chips for communication. They're looking for 75,000 vocational trained people — technicians [and] different types of degrees,\" Mînzatu said.  When asked about AI taking away entry-level roles and making it harder to enter the job market, she said: \"I'm not that concerned about the ability of the young generation to be able to have the right skills for that.\"  Meanwhile, blue-collar jobs do appear to be   — those born between 1997 and 2012 — in part because of the high cost of getting a bachelor's degree in the U.S. CNBC Make It calculations in 2025 indicated that the annual cost of attending a four-year, in-state public college increased by about 30% between 2011 and 2023. \"There are about 2 million fewer students in a traditional four-year university now than in 2011,\"  , senior economist at payroll and benefits platform Gusto, told CNBC Make It at the time.

On Thursday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen viewed Trump's discussion on Arctic security with Rutte as \" \" and said that the country is ready to hold talks with the U.S. on its \" \" missile defense plan. However, she stressed that sovereignty is non-negotiable. \"The Kingdom of Denmark wishes to continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with allies on how we can strengthen security in the Arctic, including the US's Golden Dome, provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity,\" Frederiksen said. Inflation drifted slightly further from the Federal Reserve's target in November though in line with expectations, according to the central bank's preferred gauge released Thursday. The personal consumption expenditures price index, a Commerce Department measure the central bank uses as its main forecasting tool, showed inflation at 2.8% for the month, in line with the Dow Jones consensus. In addition, the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the rate for October was 2.7% on both a headline and core basis, the latter excluding volatile food and energy prices.  .

Analyst Brad Reback expects Datadog to post better-than-expected earnings next month. He sees the company reporting more than 23% growth. Shares were up 6% in morning trading Thursday. Last quarter, Datadog beat analyst expectations and grew revenue 28% year over year. While competition and acquisitions in the cloud platform space have caused concerns among analysts, Reback remains optimistic. \"While Palo's acquisition of Chronosphere and Snowflake's recent acquisition of Observe play into the negative narrative around the crowding in the observability space and that pricing will continue to broadly compress, given the time it will take to integrate these acquisitions into their respective organizations as well as the time to adapt to the new GTM strategy/buyer, we believe the near-term impact on Datadog's growth rate should be limited,\" Reback wrote.  \"Over the medium term, we note that DDOG has effectively worked with customers to ensure value based pricing and we think the platforms overall ease of use should enable the company to at least sustain current growth rates,\" he added.  —  The three leading U.S. indexes began Thursday's session in positive territory.

The uptick reflected higher revisions in consumer spending, exports, government and investment. Also, imports decreased amid the ongoing global tariff skirmish between the U.S. and its trading partners. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity, rose at a 3.5% rate for the quarter. Final sales to domestic purchasers, a proxy for demand across the $31 trillion economy, accelerated at a 6.3% rate, the highest since Q3 of 2023. The stellar year for U.S. growth is expected to continue through the fourth quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's   running tracker of incoming data is putting the Q4 figure at 5.4%. Initial jobless claims were little changed last week, continuing a low-layoff trend that is putting a floor under the labor market. First-time filings for unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 200,000 for the week ended Jan. 17, up 1,000 from the prior week and below the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 208,000, according to a Labor Department report Thursday. On a four-week moving basis, claims have averaged 201,500, the lowest since Jan. 13, 2024. Continuing claims, which run a week behind, edged lower to 1.85 million, down 26,000 from a week ago.

Much of the optimism is tied to strong sales of Intel's latest server chips, which analysts say are benefitting from rising spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure. KeyBanc analysts upgraded the stock to the equivalent of a buy earlier this month, suggesting that Intel is likely sold out of server CPUs for this year, meaning prices could be on the rise.  \"We expect outsized data center demand from hyperscalers this year to be a significant tailwind\" for Intel's data center business, the KeyBanc analysts wrote. They have a price target of $60 for the stock, which closed above $54 on Wednesday.  Intel is also getting a boost from recent indications that the company's foundry business, which is still seeking an anchor customer, could start to secure orders and become the No. 2 chip foundry behind   and ahead of Samsung.

                "full_text": "In this article U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to grant Nvidia licenses to ship some of its more powerful artificial intelligence chips to China is ruffling the feathers of some of Washington's most prominent China hawks, including members of his own party.  The pushback intensified this week with the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee advancing a  that seeks to expand congressional oversight of AI chip exports. The proposal, known as the AI Overwatch Act, was introduced last month by Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., the committee chairman. It would require both the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Banking Committee to approve any shipment licenses for advanced chips in 30 days, giving lawmakers the power to block sales through a joint resolution. The bill comes as the Trump Administration plans to grant licenses allowing   to sell its H200 chips to China, which are far more powerful than the processors previously permitted for export.  If passed, the AI Overwatch Act would revoke existing licenses for such AI chip transfers and impose a temporary ban until the administration submits a national security strategy on AI exports. It includes exemptions for \"trusted\" U.S. companies shipping chips abroad under U.S. control, provided they meet security standards. \"Companies like Nvidia are requesting to sell millions of advanced AI chips, which are the cutting edge of warfare, to Chinese military companies like   and  ,\" said Chairman Mast, framing it as a national security risk.  The bill was also cosponsored by the Republican Chairman of the Select Committee on China, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., who   a \"critical step toward protecting America's technological edge.\" Still, it remains unclear the extent of support that the AI Overwatch Act can attract in the House and Senate.  The act is likely to serve as a linchpin in a larger battle developing in Washington between lawmakers who see Nvidia chip exports as a national security risk and officials who argue that the exports help maintain U.S. technological dominance. Among the latter camp is White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, who has already criticized the AI Overwatch Act. The Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor recently   a viral social media claim that the bill would undermine Trump's authority over AI chip exports. Sacks and those in the Trump administration who support more Nvidia shipments overseas have argued that U.S. chip restrictions have been counterproductive and have ceded ground to Chinese competitors.  Instead, they say it is advantageous for U.S.-designed chips to remain at the center of global AI infrastructure.  This is consistent with arguments made by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and industry lobbyists. Bipartisan lawmakers on the other side, however, have argued that Nvidia's H200s could bolster China's AI capabilities and be leveraged by its military.  Current U.S. chip controls require individual licenses from the Commerce Department for any exports or transfers of high-performance AI chips to entities in \"countries of concern,\" including China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. These controls have covered Nvidia's H200, one of its most powerful AI chips. But last week, Trump confirmed his administration   of the processors to China, provided the U.S. receives a 25% cut of the proceeds. Much of the pushback from lawmakers has come from the opposition party. In December, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., criticized Trump's approval of H200 exports as evidence of a \"haphazard and transactional approach\" lacking a coherent strategy against China.  \"American companies must remain the undisputed leader in AI hardware because our strategic competition with China on AI will boil down to whose ecosystem drives adoption and innovation globally,\" he said. Meanwhile, Senate Banking Committee ranking member Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has also warned that China seeks such chips for military modernization, weapons design and AI surveillance, citing Justice Department assessments. However, Trump has also faced bipartisan resistance. Before the H200, the president had also announced he would allow Nvidia to resume its sales of the H20 to China, a chip the President had restricted just months earlier.  At the time, lawmakers had also responded with additional AI chip proposals, including the   introduced in November by a bipartisan group that included Warren and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. The bill would require U.S. firms to prioritize domestic sales of advanced chips before exporting to China.  Despite Trump's policy shifts on chip exports, Chinese regulators have not allowed Nvidia's chips to flow back into the country freely.  Reuters   last week that Chinese customs authorities have been instructed to block imports of H200 chips and warned tech companies against purchasing them unless necessary.",

Last year, the company launched its first general AI agent, which can be customized to execute complex tasks such as market research, coding and data analysis.  Seth Dobrin, co-founder and CEO of Arya Labs, said Manus was his favorite agentic AI platform, but his company, which develops a type of so-called world models, is no longer using it under Meta's ownership. Dobrin told CNBC that while he had confidence in Manus' transparent terms of service, he doesn't have that level of trust in Meta and is \"legitimately sad that this has happened.\" \"I do not agree with a lot of Meta's practices around data and how they essentially weaponize people's personal data against them,\" said Dobrin, who helped launch Arya last year. \"I don't want to engage with a company who I don't feel comfortable with how they're going to use data.\" Meta, which gets almost all of its $200 billion in annualized revenue from ads,   on Dec. 29, that its purchase of Manus was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.  Manus said in a   on the day of the deal that it had reached millions of paying customers and a revenue run rate of more than $125 million. \"Our top priority is ensuring that this change won't be disruptive for our customers,\"  Manus said. \"We will continue to sell and operate our product subscription service through our app and website. The company will continue to operate from Singapore.\" Despite those assurances, Dobrin isn't alone in his concern. Karl Yeh, co-founder of consulting firm  , which advises startups on how to integrate AI tools, said he stopped using Manus at his company and has advised his clients to follow suit.  \"Will the data policies of Meta apply to Manus? I would assume it will eventually,\" Yeh told CNBC. \"That was the concern we had and why we stopped recommending it to our clients.\" \"We don't know where Manus is going to fit into Meta's AI road map,\" Yeh said. \"We're not sure if Manus is going to still remain a separate company even though they said it would.\" Yeh said he's moving to services from a startup called Genspark or somewhere else where there's more certainty because, \"In terms of Meta, we're just not sure.\" Meta didn't provide a comment beyond pointing to the blog post, which notes that, \"We're excited to welcome the Manus team and help improve the lives of billions of people and millions of businesses with their technology.\" Meta has opened its wallets to try and win in AI, most notably   more than $14 billion in June to hire Scale AI's Alexandr Wang and a handful of his top engineers and researchers and secure a stake in his startup. But unlike AI model leaders OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, Meta has yet to land on a   in the market, particularly when it comes to competing in the enterprise.  Meta's stock is down 17% since CEO   said on the last   in October that AI costs will keep growing. Analysts anticipate 2026 spending on AI could top $100 billion. Meta is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results next week.  Flo Crivello, CEO of a Manus competitor, Lindy, said his company initially saw a bump in users after news of Meta's acquisition.  \"We think there was sort of a halo effect from the announcement,\" Crivello said. \"It raised awareness about this category of software and people started researching it.\"  Crivello, who previously spent almost five years at   and worked on acquisitions, said he thinks Meta's rationale is less about bringing in enterprise customers, and more targeted at serving small businesses, which have long been crucial to Meta's ad revenue.  Crivello said Manus is \"focused on very small business owners like independent contractors,\" and said it could take a while for Meta to figure out where it takes Manus from here.  \"The way these companies think of these acquisitions, they're acquiring the company for a specific, strategic reason — they just don't know precisely what the integration might look like yet,\" Crivello said. \"They cut a check, it's a new thing they add to the chess board and then they figure it out. And sometimes it takes them years to figure out what to do.\" Outside of advertising, Meta has struggled in several areas where it's tried to crack the enterprise. The company   in 2024 that it was shuttering its Workplace communication and productivity platform, two years after   its Portal video calling device.  Last week, Meta said it's sunsetting its   virtual reality app, part of a broader   from VR, which had been Zuckerberg's big focus area before AI took off.  Navrina Singh, founder and CEO of governance startup Credo AI, says she doesn't see Fortune 500 companies embracing Meta's tools.  \"Among large enterprises — particularly in highly regulated sectors like health care and financial services — many AI deployments today are built on models from providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic,\" Singh said. Then they're typically run through cloud platforms operated by   or  , \"where trust, security, and accountability requirements are well-established and prioritized,\" she said. One area where Meta is finding success in the business world is WhatsApp, the messaging platform it acquired for $19 billion in 2014. WhatsApp for Business has become a popular way for companies to interact with customers. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore, has projected WhatsApp could generate $40 billion in revenue by 2030.  \"Business messaging remains a significant opportunity for us,\" Meta CFO Susan Li said on the company's last earnings call. \"We're also making good progress on our business AI efforts, where we've been focused on building a turnkey AI that helps businesses generate leads and drive sales.\"",

Huang, one of the foremost voices on artificial intelligence, struck an optimistic tone on its impact on the labor market in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos Wednesday.  \"This is the largest infrastructure build-out in human history that's going to create a lot of jobs,\" Huang said. \"It's wonderful that the jobs are related to trade craft, and we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steel workers, and network technicians, and people who install and fit out the equipment.\"  Huang added that he was seeing \"quite a significant boom\" in this area, with salaries nearly doubling.  \"And so we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories,\" he added. The possibility of AI eliminating jobs has dominated conversations at WEF this week after the technology was seen as contributing to   in the U.S. in 2025, per December data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. ,  ,  , and   were among the companies citing AI as a reason for  .  Kristalina Georgieva, managing director at the International Monetary Fund, said Tuesday that AI is \"hitting the labor market like a tsunami, and most countries and most businesses are not prepared for it.\"  However,  found that blue-collar jobs were the least likely to be automated and hence safer from job cuts and layoffs. The roles named ranged from phlebotomists to helpers, painters, plasterers, and ship engineers.  The research, which analyzed data from 200,000 conversations with Microsoft Bing Copilot between January and September 2024, focused on how much users sought assistance from the chatbot to complete a task. Professionals who did physical work, whether with people or machines, were least likely to rely on AI.  \"Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don't need to have a PhD in computer science to do so,\" Huang said.  Roxana Mînzatu, EVP for social rights and skills, quality jobs, and preparedness at the European Commission, told CNBC in a conversation at WEF that young people should pursue vocational training in order to secure these blue-collar roles.  \"There are a lot of job offers in the vocational direction. I've had a discussion with the semiconductor industry, those that produce the chips for communication. They're looking for 75,000 vocational trained people — technicians [and] different types of degrees,\" Mînzatu said.  When asked about AI taking away entry-level roles and making it harder to enter the job market, she said: \"I'm not that concerned about the ability of the young generation to be able to have the right skills for that.\"  Meanwhile, blue-collar jobs do appear to be   — those born between 1997 and 2012 — in part because of the high cost of getting a bachelor's degree in the U.S. CNBC Make It calculations in 2025 indicated that the annual cost of attending a four-year, in-state public college increased by about 30% between 2011 and 2023. \"There are about 2 million fewer students in a traditional four-year university now than in 2011,\"  , senior economist at payroll and benefits platform Gusto, told CNBC Make It at the time.

Miami is the sixth market where Waymo offers driverless ride-hailing service, extending its lead over   and  -owned Zoox. As U.S. competition has lagged, Waymo's planned 2026 expansions could lock in rider demand and loyalty in the U.S. To start, Waymo will offer its services within a 60-square-mile area that includes Miami's Design District, Wynwood, Brickell and Coral Gables neighborhoods, the  .  The company began testing its vehicles in the Florida city in early 2025. Waymo said it plans to extend its service to the Miami International Airport in the near future, but did not give a specific timeline.  The company said \"nearly 10,000 residents\" of Miami have already signed up to try its robotaxi service, and Waymo will be \"inviting new riders on a rolling basis.\" Riders can hail a Waymo robotaxi in Miami using the company's app.  Waymo is partnering with mobility company Moove for fleet management services including vehicle charging, cleaning and repairs. The Miami launch comes after Waymo has faced public concerns over the safety and driving behavior of its vehicles. Waymo's vehicles contributed to gridlock during storms and widespread   in San Francisco last month.

                "full_text": "In this article China's technology giants are entering a new phase of the artificial intelligence race called 'agentic commerce,' as firms such as Alibaba and ByteDance race to turn chatbots into full-service shopping and payment tools. Alibaba last week  , allowing users to complete transactions directly within the interface, including ordering food and booking air tickets. The upgrade connects Qwen to Alibaba's broader e-commerce ecosystem, allowing users to compare tailored product recommendations from platforms such as Taobao or its travel site Fliggy, before finally completing payments through Alipay, all without leaving the chatbot. Previously, Qwen could make recommendations based on user-generated prompts, but users still had to manually navigate multiple platforms to make purchases. The update reflects a broader shift among some global artificial intelligence firms from a focus on foundational AI models to \"agentic AI\", which performs tasks on behalf of users with limited supervision. \"The agentic transformation of commercial services enables the maximal integration of user services [and] enhances user stickiness,\" said Shaochen Wang, a research analyst at Counterpoint Research, referring to stronger long-term user engagement. That allows companies to build a sustainable competitive advantage, often called a business moat, which helps protect profits from competitors, he added. While commercial applications for agentic AI are expected to range from autonomous driving to cybersecurity, e-commerce is emerging as one of its earliest and most pervasive use cases, with payment and tech giants in the U.S. also   in recent months. Within China, Alibaba is well-positioned to be a pioneer in agentic commerce due to its advanced large language model capabilities and its extensive e-commerce network covering clothing, food, housing, and transportation, Wang said. Alibaba's strategy could help it compete with rival super apps such as Tencent's WeChat — widely regarded as China's leading 'super app' — which combines messaging, payments, e-commerce and other services into a single platform used by over 1 billion users. Other Chinese firms are also moving quickly.  ByteDance in December upgraded its popular Doubao AI chatbot to autonomously handle tasks such as ticket bookings through integrations with e-commerce features on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. The upgraded Doubao model was introduced on a prototype smartphone developed by ZTE Corp  capable of performing tasks across a user's mobile device. However,   were later   after rivals raised privacy and security concerns. Meanwhile, Tencent President Martin Lau said during the company's   that AI agents could become core components of the WeChat ecosystem.  \"AI agents will be foundational to the evolution of super apps, with success depending on deep integration across payments, logistics, and social engagement,\" Charlie Dai, VP and principal analyst at Forrester, told CNBC. While Chinese firms like  ,   and ByteDance will compete to embed agents across their platforms, they all benefit from integrated ecosystems, rich behavioral data, and consumer familiarity with super apps, said Dai. Western companies, while leading in foundational AI models and global reach, face more fragmented data and stricter privacy regulations, slowing cross-service integration, he added. U.S. players pursuing agentic commerce include OpenAI, Perplexity, and  .   is also exploring ways to position itself as a \" \" between merchants, consumers and AI agents. \"China will prioritize domestic integration and strategic expansion in selected regions, while U.S. firms focus on global scalability and governance,\" Dai noted. Approximately half of all consumers already use AI when searching online, according to a  .  The report estimated that AI agents could generate more than $1 trillion in economic value for U.S. businesses by 2030 by streamlining important yet routine steps in consumer decision-making.",

                "full_text": "In this article The future of the   company – its iconic movie studio, HBO Max, and its cable networks, including CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery and HGTV – may come down to what European regulators think about  . That's a pretty crazy twist for a deal that will dictate the future of many valuable American sports rights – assets that, for the most part, have very little to do with Europe. A quick refresher: WBD owns many live U.S. sports rights, including those to March Madness, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, the French Open, AEW, the College Football Playoffs and others. But those rights wouldn't go to Netflix under   to sell some of its assets to the streaming giant. Netflix has agreed to pay $27.75 per share for the WBD movie studio and streaming business, but not the cable networks, which own the sports rights. If the deal is approved, those networks would get spun out into a separate publicly traded entity called Discovery Global, which would also own Bleacher Report, House of Highlights and WBD's other digital assets. If WBD shareholders accept a   from  , however – and if that deal is approved – the cable networks and associated sports would all fall under the Paramount umbrella. Paramount has bid $30 per share for the entirety of WBD – an offer it has taken directly to shareholders after the WBD board rejected it. Paramount on Thursday   on its tender offer — which expired Wednesday — giving WBD shareholders more time to weigh the option.  WBD responded with a statement, noting that less than 7% of all shareholders have tendered their shares thus far to Paramount. \"Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. It's also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount's inferior scheme,\" WBD said. \"We are confident in our ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Netflix merger and look forward to delivering the tremendous and certain value our agreement will provide to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.\" Most media attention has focused on what U.S. President Donald Trump   a Netflix-WBD deal. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Trump ahead of the deal to gauge his sentiment on a transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice — theoretically an independent body from the presidency – will ultimately decide whether or not the deal presents antitrust problems, and if those issues can be ameliorated with conditions or if they're simply too big for a deal to go through. There's been far less attention paid to Europe, which will also need to approve a deal. And that's where either deal could fall apart.  Netflix is a global company, generating about $14.5 billion in revenue in its \"EMEA\" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region last year, or about 32% of total sales.  WBD feels confident its Netflix deal will win EU approval, according to people familiar with the matter. A WBD source said there was a \"95% certainty\" that Europe would approve the transaction, though the person did acknowledge Netflix may need to agree to certain conditions, such as agreeing to produce a certain amount of local content in Europe and promising to release movies into theaters. The EU's   already mandates that video-on-demand streaming services ensure at least 30% of programming in EU countries qualify as European works.  Paramount disagrees and believes a Netflix deal has very little chance of making it past European regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. At the same time, it's working its own EU regulatory angles for its proposed takeover. It would be unusual but not unprecedented for European regulators to block a deal between two U.S.-based companies.     $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma in December 2023 after deciding there was \"no clear path\" to gaining antitrust approval in Europe and the U.K. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority     Facebook to sell Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks, in 2022. The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. . It's also worth noting the European Commission allowed Amazon to acquire MGM, perhaps the closest comparison in terms of comparative businesses to this deal. Paramount's confidence stems from the continent's track record of being tough on tech companies, with antitrust crackdowns and penalties   Meta,  ,     and Amazon in recent years. Paramount executives believe EU regulators view Netflix similarly, based on recent conversations they've had with European officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Given the chance to stop a Big Tech company from gaining even more market power, Paramount executives believe Europe will take it. The EU may also be more parochial in how it treats movie theater owners, viewing them as essential to culture and art. Both U.S. and European trade associations for the cinema industry have   their   with a Netflix-Warner combination. This week, Sarandos reiterated that Warner Bros. films will be released in theaters with a 45-day window — as they always have. \"We're working closely with WBD and the regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals,\" Sarandos said Tuesday during   \"When this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled, world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. And we're excited to maintain it and further strengthen that business.\" The WBD board viewed two movie studios coming together – Paramount and Warner – as a bigger regulatory hurdle than any issue presented by Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, WBD's lawyers have determined both deals – Netflix-WBD and Paramount-WBD – would likely gain approval. \"The WBD Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the [Paramount tender] Offer with its regulatory advisors,\" WBD said in a December corporate filing. \"The WBD Board is of the view that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material.\" On the movie theater issue, a Warner source told me WBD actually views Paramount as a potentially bigger issue than Netflix. That's because WBD's board and executives aren't sure Paramount will have the money to produce 30 or more movies a year (a Paramount CEO David Ellison  ) while also paying down billions of dollars in debt and targeting $6 billion in cost savings.  This is why the structure of the Paramount deal is so important to WBD. To create a superior deal for WBD, Larry Ellison, David's father and one of the world's wealthiest men, would need to put up more money in equity to lower the leverage ratio of a combined company. The board doesn't trust Paramount can deliver on its synergies while also meeting its aggressive theatrical goals and moving forward with a leverage ratio over 7-times estimated 2026 EBITDA. This week, Netflix changed its offer for WBD's assets from mostly cash to  . Simplifying the bid allows WBD to move its shareholder meeting to approve the Netflix offer earlier – possibly as early as March, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount is still considering if it wants to raise its bid or change the capital structure to re-engage the WBD board, according to people familiar with the matter. It could also do nothing and wait to see if it's right about regulators – either European or American – blocking a Netflix deal. With so much attention on the importance of live sports to the TV industry, it's unusual to see them as such an afterthought. Paramount executives have argued the value of Discovery Global should be $0 based on its high leverage ratio and the early valuation of Versant, the parent company of CNBC, which has traded down almost 30% since it debuted on the public markets this month. In a   released Tuesday, WBD argued Discovery Global should be valued between $1.33 per share and $6.86 per share, depending on estimates.",

                "full_text": "In this article When   agreed to spend a reported $2 billion on   at the end of last year, the social media giant said it planned to take the startup's subscription AI agent offering and \"scale this service to many more businesses.\" But some existing Manus customers aren't thrilled with the deal and say they're now going elsewhere, the latest sign of skepticism toward Meta as it tries to compete with the likes of OpenAI,   and Anthropic in the booming artificial intelligence market.  Manus, a developer of general purpose AI agents, was founded in China in 2022 before relocating to Singapore. Last year, the company launched its first general AI agent, which can be customized to execute complex tasks such as market research, coding and data analysis.  Seth Dobrin, co-founder and CEO of Arya Labs, said Manus was his favorite agentic AI platform, but his company, which develops a type of so-called world models, is no longer using it under Meta's ownership. Dobrin told CNBC that while he had confidence in Manus' transparent terms of service, he doesn't have that level of trust in Meta and is \"legitimately sad that this has happened.\" \"I do not agree with a lot of Meta's practices around data and how they essentially weaponize people's personal data against them,\" said Dobrin, who helped launch Arya last year. \"I don't want to engage with a company who I don't feel comfortable with how they're going to use data.\" Meta, which gets almost all of its $200 billion in annualized revenue from ads,   on Dec. 29, that its purchase of Manus was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.  Manus said in a   on the day of the deal that it had reached millions of paying customers and a revenue run rate of more than $125 million. \"Our top priority is ensuring that this change won't be disruptive for our customers,\"  Manus said. \"We will continue to sell and operate our product subscription service through our app and website. The company will continue to operate from Singapore.\" Despite those assurances, Dobrin isn't alone in his concern. Karl Yeh, co-founder of consulting firm  , which advises startups on how to integrate AI tools, said he stopped using Manus at his company and has advised his clients to follow suit.  \"Will the data policies of Meta apply to Manus? I would assume it will eventually,\" Yeh told CNBC. \"That was the concern we had and why we stopped recommending it to our clients.\" \"We don't know where Manus is going to fit into Meta's AI road map,\" Yeh said. \"We're not sure if Manus is going to still remain a separate company even though they said it would.\" Yeh said he's moving to services from a startup called Genspark or somewhere else where there's more certainty because, \"In terms of Meta, we're just not sure.\" Meta didn't provide a comment beyond pointing to the blog post, which notes that, \"We're excited to welcome the Manus team and help improve the lives of billions of people and millions of businesses with their technology.\" Meta has opened its wallets to try and win in AI, most notably   more than $14 billion in June to hire Scale AI's Alexandr Wang and a handful of his top engineers and researchers and secure a stake in his startup. But unlike AI model leaders OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, Meta has yet to land on a   in the market, particularly when it comes to competing in the enterprise.  Meta's stock is down 17% since CEO   said on the last   in October that AI costs will keep growing. Analysts anticipate 2026 spending on AI could top $100 billion. Meta is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results next week.  Flo Crivello, CEO of a Manus competitor, Lindy, said his company initially saw a bump in users after news of Meta's acquisition.  \"We think there was sort of a halo effect from the announcement,\" Crivello said. \"It raised awareness about this category of software and people started researching it.\"  Crivello, who previously spent almost five years at   and worked on acquisitions, said he thinks Meta's rationale is less about bringing in enterprise customers, and more targeted at serving small businesses, which have long been crucial to Meta's ad revenue.  Crivello said Manus is \"focused on very small business owners like independent contractors,\" and said it could take a while for Meta to figure out where it takes Manus from here.  \"The way these companies think of these acquisitions, they're acquiring the company for a specific, strategic reason — they just don't know precisely what the integration might look like yet,\" Crivello said. \"They cut a check, it's a new thing they add to the chess board and then they figure it out. And sometimes it takes them years to figure out what to do.\" Outside of advertising, Meta has struggled in several areas where it's tried to crack the enterprise. The company   in 2024 that it was shuttering its Workplace communication and productivity platform, two years after   its Portal video calling device.  Last week, Meta said it's sunsetting its   virtual reality app, part of a broader   from VR, which had been Zuckerberg's big focus area before AI took off.  Navrina Singh, founder and CEO of governance startup Credo AI, says she doesn't see Fortune 500 companies embracing Meta's tools.  \"Among large enterprises — particularly in highly regulated sectors like health care and financial services — many AI deployments today are built on models from providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic,\" Singh said. Then they're typically run through cloud platforms operated by   or  , \"where trust, security, and accountability requirements are well-established and prioritized,\" she said. One area where Meta is finding success in the business world is WhatsApp, the messaging platform it acquired for $19 billion in 2014. WhatsApp for Business has become a popular way for companies to interact with customers. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore, has projected WhatsApp could generate $40 billion in revenue by 2030.  \"Business messaging remains a significant opportunity for us,\" Meta CFO Susan Li said on the company's last earnings call. \"We're also making good progress on our business AI efforts, where we've been focused on building a turnkey AI that helps businesses generate leads and drive sales.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article  on Wednesday rolled out an     assistant for members of its primary care chain One Medical, joining the likes of   and  , which recently launched similar features. The tool, called Health AI, uses large language models from Amazon's Bedrock service to answer questions and provide members with personalized advice based on their medical records, lab results and current medications.  It can also assist with managing medications and book appointments with a user's One Medical provider.  The tool pulls answers from a variety of sources, including licensed and proprietary data, knowledge verified by medical experts and in some cases, publicly-available data, Amazon said. Health AI appears in the app for One Medical, the health-care company Amazon acquired for   in 2023. One Medical runs brick-and-mortar clinics and also offers some telehealth services to members who pay between $99 and $199 a year for its services. Amazon said Health AI isn't intended to provide diagnosis or treatment, and it shouldn't replace a doctor's visit. The tool is \"programmed with clinical protocols\" that identify when symptoms or conditions require escalation to a provider or for an in-person visit, the company said. Conversations with Health AI also aren't added to a patient's medical records, Amazon said.  The company   Health AI among a subset of One Medical members last Spring before rolling out the tool more broadly. Other AI providers have also jumped into the lucrative health-care market.  Earlier this month, OpenAI launched  , a feature within its chatbot that enables users to upload medical records and receive personalized advice. Anthropic released its   feature shortly after.  Amazon said Health AI is easier for patients to use because it doesn't require them to upload documents or connect outside apps, and it's \"more actionable\" compared to other offerings. \"In short: other AI health chatbots provide general health information,\" Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, told CNBC in a statement. \"One Medical's Health AI assistant knows your health story, can take actions based on a patient's request, and keeps your trusted providers in the lead. It's the difference between getting answers and getting care.\" Amazon has   into health-care over the past decade. In addition to acquiring One Medical, Amazon also bought online pharmacy PillPack for about $750 million in 2018. Two years later, it launched its own offering called  . The company said Health AI may direct users to One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy services \"where it is helpful,\" but protected health information isn't used to market or advertise general merchandise from its broader webstore.",

The   index of small-cap stocks gained about 2% and notched a record close. \"The Greenland crisis appears to be defusing and reversing the recent sell-off, although details are still forthcoming around the 'framework,'\" said Eric Teal, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management. He said that the relief rally sparked significant gains in traditional value sectors such as financials and energy stocks.

Inflation drifted slightly further from the Federal Reserve's target in November though in line with expectations, according to the central bank's preferred gauge released Thursday.

Analyst Brad Reback expects Datadog to post better-than-expected earnings next month. He sees the company reporting more than 23% growth. Shares were up 6% in morning trading Thursday. Last quarter, Datadog beat analyst expectations and grew revenue 28% year over year. While competition and acquisitions in the cloud platform space have caused concerns among analysts, Reback remains optimistic. \"While Palo's acquisition of Chronosphere and Snowflake's recent acquisition of Observe play into the negative narrative around the crowding in the observability space and that pricing will continue to broadly compress, given the time it will take to integrate these acquisitions into their respective organizations as well as the time to adapt to the new GTM strategy/buyer, we believe the near-term impact on Datadog's growth rate should be limited,\" Reback wrote.  \"Over the medium term, we note that DDOG has effectively worked with customers to ensure value based pricing and we think the platforms overall ease of use should enable the company to at least sustain current growth rates,\" he added.  —  The three leading U.S. indexes began Thursday's session in positive territory.

The uptick reflected higher revisions in consumer spending, exports, government and investment. Also, imports decreased amid the ongoing global tariff skirmish between the U.S. and its trading partners. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity, rose at a 3.5% rate for the quarter. Final sales to domestic purchasers, a proxy for demand across the $31 trillion economy, accelerated at a 6.3% rate, the highest since Q3 of 2023. The stellar year for U.S. growth is expected to continue through the fourth quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's   running tracker of incoming data is putting the Q4 figure at 5.4%.

                "full_text": "In this article The future of the   company – its iconic movie studio, HBO Max, and its cable networks, including CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery and HGTV – may come down to what European regulators think about  . That's a pretty crazy twist for a deal that will dictate the future of many valuable American sports rights – assets that, for the most part, have very little to do with Europe. A quick refresher: WBD owns many live U.S. sports rights, including those to March Madness, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, the French Open, AEW, the College Football Playoffs and others. But those rights wouldn't go to Netflix under   to sell some of its assets to the streaming giant. Netflix has agreed to pay $27.75 per share for the WBD movie studio and streaming business, but not the cable networks, which own the sports rights. If the deal is approved, those networks would get spun out into a separate publicly traded entity called Discovery Global, which would also own Bleacher Report, House of Highlights and WBD's other digital assets. If WBD shareholders accept a   from  , however – and if that deal is approved – the cable networks and associated sports would all fall under the Paramount umbrella. Paramount has bid $30 per share for the entirety of WBD – an offer it has taken directly to shareholders after the WBD board rejected it. Paramount on Thursday   on its tender offer — which expired Wednesday — giving WBD shareholders more time to weigh the option.  WBD responded with a statement, noting that less than 7% of all shareholders have tendered their shares thus far to Paramount. \"Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. It's also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount's inferior scheme,\" WBD said. \"We are confident in our ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Netflix merger and look forward to delivering the tremendous and certain value our agreement will provide to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.\" Most media attention has focused on what U.S. President Donald Trump   a Netflix-WBD deal. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Trump ahead of the deal to gauge his sentiment on a transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice — theoretically an independent body from the presidency – will ultimately decide whether or not the deal presents antitrust problems, and if those issues can be ameliorated with conditions or if they're simply too big for a deal to go through. There's been far less attention paid to Europe, which will also need to approve a deal. And that's where either deal could fall apart.  Netflix is a global company, generating about $14.5 billion in revenue in its \"EMEA\" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region last year, or about 32% of total sales.  WBD feels confident its Netflix deal will win EU approval, according to people familiar with the matter. A WBD source said there was a \"95% certainty\" that Europe would approve the transaction, though the person did acknowledge Netflix may need to agree to certain conditions, such as agreeing to produce a certain amount of local content in Europe and promising to release movies into theaters. The EU's   already mandates that video-on-demand streaming services ensure at least 30% of programming in EU countries qualify as European works.  Paramount disagrees and believes a Netflix deal has very little chance of making it past European regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. At the same time, it's working its own EU regulatory angles for its proposed takeover. It would be unusual but not unprecedented for European regulators to block a deal between two U.S.-based companies.     $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma in December 2023 after deciding there was \"no clear path\" to gaining antitrust approval in Europe and the U.K. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority     Facebook to sell Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks, in 2022. The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. . It's also worth noting the European Commission allowed Amazon to acquire MGM, perhaps the closest comparison in terms of comparative businesses to this deal. Paramount's confidence stems from the continent's track record of being tough on tech companies, with antitrust crackdowns and penalties   Meta,  ,     and Amazon in recent years. Paramount executives believe EU regulators view Netflix similarly, based on recent conversations they've had with European officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Given the chance to stop a Big Tech company from gaining even more market power, Paramount executives believe Europe will take it. The EU may also be more parochial in how it treats movie theater owners, viewing them as essential to culture and art. Both U.S. and European trade associations for the cinema industry have   their   with a Netflix-Warner combination. This week, Sarandos reiterated that Warner Bros. films will be released in theaters with a 45-day window — as they always have. \"We're working closely with WBD and the regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals,\" Sarandos said Tuesday during   \"When this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled, world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. And we're excited to maintain it and further strengthen that business.\" The WBD board viewed two movie studios coming together – Paramount and Warner – as a bigger regulatory hurdle than any issue presented by Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, WBD's lawyers have determined both deals – Netflix-WBD and Paramount-WBD – would likely gain approval. \"The WBD Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the [Paramount tender] Offer with its regulatory advisors,\" WBD said in a December corporate filing. \"The WBD Board is of the view that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material.\" On the movie theater issue, a Warner source told me WBD actually views Paramount as a potentially bigger issue than Netflix. That's because WBD's board and executives aren't sure Paramount will have the money to produce 30 or more movies a year (a Paramount CEO David Ellison  ) while also paying down billions of dollars in debt and targeting $6 billion in cost savings.  This is why the structure of the Paramount deal is so important to WBD. To create a superior deal for WBD, Larry Ellison, David's father and one of the world's wealthiest men, would need to put up more money in equity to lower the leverage ratio of a combined company. The board doesn't trust Paramount can deliver on its synergies while also meeting its aggressive theatrical goals and moving forward with a leverage ratio over 7-times estimated 2026 EBITDA. This week, Netflix changed its offer for WBD's assets from mostly cash to  . Simplifying the bid allows WBD to move its shareholder meeting to approve the Netflix offer earlier – possibly as early as March, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount is still considering if it wants to raise its bid or change the capital structure to re-engage the WBD board, according to people familiar with the matter. It could also do nothing and wait to see if it's right about regulators – either European or American – blocking a Netflix deal. With so much attention on the importance of live sports to the TV industry, it's unusual to see them as such an afterthought. Paramount executives have argued the value of Discovery Global should be $0 based on its high leverage ratio and the early valuation of Versant, the parent company of CNBC, which has traded down almost 30% since it debuted on the public markets this month. In a   released Tuesday, WBD argued Discovery Global should be valued between $1.33 per share and $6.86 per share, depending on estimates.",

The company is also testing in New York, Tokyo and London, and has also said it will launch its first overseas commercial service this year. In December, Waymo crossed   weekly paid rides, and the company said it had served   trips in 2025. The company is in talks to raise $15 billion in funding,   last month.  The Alphabet company faces its most formidable competition from Baidu-owned Apollo Go and WeRide in Asia, but Amazon's Zoox and Elon Musk's  , along with startups like May Mobility and Nuro, are aiming to compete with Waymo in North America.",

That's a pretty crazy twist for a deal that will dictate the future of many valuable American sports rights – assets that, for the most part, have very little to do with Europe. A quick refresher: WBD owns many live U.S. sports rights, including those to March Madness, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, the French Open, AEW, the College Football Playoffs and others. But those rights wouldn't go to Netflix under   to sell some of its assets to the streaming giant. Netflix has agreed to pay $27.75 per share for the WBD movie studio and streaming business, but not the cable networks, which own the sports rights. If the deal is approved, those networks would get spun out into a separate publicly traded entity called Discovery Global, which would also own Bleacher Report, House of Highlights and WBD's other digital assets. If WBD shareholders accept a   from  , however – and if that deal is approved – the cable networks and associated sports would all fall under the Paramount umbrella. Paramount has bid $30 per share for the entirety of WBD – an offer it has taken directly to shareholders after the WBD board rejected it. Paramount on Thursday   on its tender offer — which expired Wednesday — giving WBD shareholders more time to weigh the option.  WBD responded with a statement, noting that less than 7% of all shareholders have tendered their shares thus far to Paramount. \"Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. It's also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount's inferior scheme,\" WBD said. \"We are confident in our ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Netflix merger and look forward to delivering the tremendous and certain value our agreement will provide to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.\" Most media attention has focused on what U.S. President Donald Trump   a Netflix-WBD deal. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Trump ahead of the deal to gauge his sentiment on a transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice — theoretically an independent body from the presidency – will ultimately decide whether or not the deal presents antitrust problems, and if those issues can be ameliorated with conditions or if they're simply too big for a deal to go through. There's been far less attention paid to Europe, which will also need to approve a deal. And that's where either deal could fall apart.  Netflix is a global company, generating about $14.5 billion in revenue in its \"EMEA\" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region last year, or about 32% of total sales.  WBD feels confident its Netflix deal will win EU approval, according to people familiar with the matter. A WBD source said there was a \"95% certainty\" that Europe would approve the transaction, though the person did acknowledge Netflix may need to agree to certain conditions, such as agreeing to produce a certain amount of local content in Europe and promising to release movies into theaters. The EU's   already mandates that video-on-demand streaming services ensure at least 30% of programming in EU countries qualify as European works.  Paramount disagrees and believes a Netflix deal has very little chance of making it past European regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. At the same time, it's working its own EU regulatory angles for its proposed takeover. It would be unusual but not unprecedented for European regulators to block a deal between two U.S.-based companies.     $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma in December 2023 after deciding there was \"no clear path\" to gaining antitrust approval in Europe and the U.K. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority     Facebook to sell Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks, in 2022.

It's also worth noting the European Commission allowed Amazon to acquire MGM, perhaps the closest comparison in terms of comparative businesses to this deal. Paramount's confidence stems from the continent's track record of being tough on tech companies, with antitrust crackdowns and penalties   Meta,  ,     and Amazon in recent years. Paramount executives believe EU regulators view Netflix similarly, based on recent conversations they've had with European officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Given the chance to stop a Big Tech company from gaining even more market power, Paramount executives believe Europe will take it. The EU may also be more parochial in how it treats movie theater owners, viewing them as essential to culture and art. Both U.S. and European trade associations for the cinema industry have   their   with a Netflix-Warner combination. This week, Sarandos reiterated that Warner Bros. films will be released in theaters with a 45-day window — as they always have. \"We're working closely with WBD and the regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals,\" Sarandos said Tuesday during   \"When this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled, world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. And we're excited to maintain it and further strengthen that business.\" The WBD board viewed two movie studios coming together – Paramount and Warner – as a bigger regulatory hurdle than any issue presented by Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, WBD's lawyers have determined both deals – Netflix-WBD and Paramount-WBD – would likely gain approval. \"The WBD Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the [Paramount tender] Offer with its regulatory advisors,\" WBD said in a December corporate filing. \"The WBD Board is of the view that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material.\" On the movie theater issue, a Warner source told me WBD actually views Paramount as a potentially bigger issue than Netflix. That's because WBD's board and executives aren't sure Paramount will have the money to produce 30 or more movies a year (a Paramount CEO David Ellison  ) while also paying down billions of dollars in debt and targeting $6 billion in cost savings.  This is why the structure of the Paramount deal is so important to WBD. To create a superior deal for WBD, Larry Ellison, David's father and one of the world's wealthiest men, would need to put up more money in equity to lower the leverage ratio of a combined company. The board doesn't trust Paramount can deliver on its synergies while also meeting its aggressive theatrical goals and moving forward with a leverage ratio over 7-times estimated 2026 EBITDA. This week, Netflix changed its offer for WBD's assets from mostly cash to  . Simplifying the bid allows WBD to move its shareholder meeting to approve the Netflix offer earlier – possibly as early as March, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount is still considering if it wants to raise its bid or change the capital structure to re-engage the WBD board, according to people familiar with the matter. It could also do nothing and wait to see if it's right about regulators – either European or American – blocking a Netflix deal. With so much attention on the importance of live sports to the TV industry, it's unusual to see them as such an afterthought. Paramount executives have argued the value of Discovery Global should be $0 based on its high leverage ratio and the early valuation of Versant, the parent company of CNBC, which has traded down almost 30% since it debuted on the public markets this month.

Tesla shares rose 4.2% on Thursday to close at $449.36. Tesla lags behind several companies that are already operating commercial robotaxi services with no drivers or safety monitors present.   Waymo leads the U.S. market, while   Apollo Go is out front in China with significant competition from  Other players are joining the fray, as   Zoox is now operating limited driverless services in the U.S., and startups like May Mobility and Nuro are developing their driverless offerings. Musk said in July that Tesla would likely have \"  ride hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year.\" The company fell far shy of that goal.  However, Tesla drummed up excitement with the launch of its Robotaxi ride-hailing app, and its initial services in Austin and the San Francisco Bay area. In Texas, Tesla obtained a permit to run a transportation networking company, which allowed it to use \"automated driving systems,\" or driverless vehicles, there. But in California, Tesla has yet to obtain permits that would allow it to conduct driverless testing or robotaxi rides without a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Musk said, \"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point,\" adding that he expects his company's Robotaxi service will be \"very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.\"  Musk is notorious for missing his self-imposed timelines for grand technical or business achievements. In 2019, he told investors that he   the company would be able to turn its existing vehicles into robotaxis with a software update by the end of the following year. With its EV sales sliding, Tesla's ability to keep investors enthused may hinge on whether it can scale a driverless, ride-hailing service in the U.S. this year and upgrade the partially automated driving systems in its cars to a fully automated driving system. Today, its premium system is marketed as FSD (Supervised), and the company plans to sell an FSD Unsupervised system in the future. Surveys by the   found a majority of U.S. consumers polled late last year did not want to ride in robotaxis, with particular concerns around safety. Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note this week that they anticipated \"muted underlying volume growth\" for Tesla and EV maker   this year with \"autonomy and physical AI driving the narrative.\" They also said, \"Tesla will have to prove out FSD unsupervised and the scaling up of robotaxi (which in our view has been clearly tracking behind schedule) before garnering incremental valuation credit.\"  Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Late last year, California regulators found that Tesla had engaged in deceptive marketing and   around their vehicles' driverless capabilities. And the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is   Tesla to determine how often the company's FSD systems may have caused traffic safety violations. According to  , which draws on NHTSA data, legal filings and press reports to track fatal Tesla collisions, 65 people have died in Tesla crashes that involved the use of Autopilot, including two in which the company's FSD systems were engaged in the seconds leading up to the crash. Tesla is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.",

                "full_text": "In this article DETROIT — The only consistency has been inconsistency for the U.S. automotive industry during the first half of this decade — a trend that's expected to continue amid challenging market conditions in 2026. The U.S. auto sector — a crucial driver of the economy estimated around   — has endured rolling crises since the Covid-19 pandemic shuttered U.S. assembly plants in early 2020. The global health crisis was followed by yearslong supply chain issues,  , political whipsawing, tariffs and other challenges for all-electric and autonomous vehicles. Automakers have been surprisingly resilient during the challenges, but those issues are now combining with more traditional industry problems of affordability and slowing consumer demand. That's all creating a more challenging environment for automakers in 2026. \"We've got to plan for the worst and hope for the best,\" Hyundai North America CEO Randy Parker told CNBC during an interview. \"That's the situation that we're in right now.\" Other executives have expressed similar sentiments as they prepare for a \"new\" U.S. automotive industry: one that's more expensive, smaller and, by many means, less predictable. Automotive forecasters are calling for steady to lower sales this year, despite industry sales only hitting  . That was the highest level since the pandemic in 2020, but down from more than 17 million for five consecutive years before the global health crisis, according to industry data. \"Anyone in the auto industry … we should all be very careful about consumer demand,\"   CEO   said Jan. 13 during an event for the Detroit Auto Show. \"That's really important.\" One of the largest industry issues — and one that's a culmination of many factors — is the affordability of new vehicles.  New vehicles prices have climbed; the average transaction price was hovering around $50,000 toward the end of last year, up 30% from less than $38,747 to begin 2020,  . Average transaction prices historically increased on average 3.2% year-over-year, but from 2020-2022 that average nearly tripled to 9%. \"Pandemic-induced production constraints and supply chain chaos didn't just disrupt the market temporarily. They fundamentally restructured pricing dynamics. This elevated plateau is now the new baseline, which has the market anchored at these higher price points,\" said Erin Keating, Cox Automotive senior director of economic and industry insights. It's not just vehicle prices hitting consumers' wallets either. They're also dealing with inflation, increases in maintenance and repairs, and 13% annual average increases for insurance over the past five years, according to Cox Automotive. \"The cumulative weight of all these increases has pushed total vehicle ownership costs beyond reach for many middle- and lower-income households, constraining market access and accelerating the affordability crisis,\" said Cox Automotive interim chief economist Jeremy Robb.  Cox Automotive reports it took 33.7 weeks of median household income to buy the average new vehicle in November 2019. Now it's 36.3 weeks. That's down from a record high of 42.2 weeks during the pandemic, but still means vehicles cost thousands of dollars more than historic levels. David Christ,   U.S. sales chief, warned that the current tariff and trade environment will cause prices to continue to increase this year, despite the concerns. \"On our end, we're just taking it month-to-month, and we're watching the competitors closely,\" Christ said on a call with reporters earlier this month. \"But we feel prices are going to go up for us and for our competitors.\"  To combat the slower sales and affordability challenges, Toyota and other automakers have said they will refocus on lower-priced vehicle models — a change from recent years when automakers prioritized their most expensive, highly profitable vehicles during supply chain shortages. \"Every automaker must face the reality that the American market has changed for the foreseeable future,\" said Lance Woelfer, head of American   U.S. sales. For Honda, Woelfer said that means increasing production on less expensive trims as well as focusing on certified pre-owned vehicles, which are used but backed by company warranties. For others, such as Ford, that could include reentering abandoned segments such as sedans, according to its CEO. \"Never say never,\"   during the event in Detroit. \"The sedan market is very vibrant. It's not that there isn't a market there. It's just we couldn't find a way to compete and be profitable. Well, we may find a way to do that.\" Ford sells sedans outside of the U.S. but exited the domestic market with the cancellation of the Michigan-made Fusion in 2020. It also eliminated the larger Taurus sedan and smaller   and Ford Focus before that. Ford's crosstown rivals   and   have largely exited the traditional U.S. sedan market as well. Affordability concerns are generating attention from outside the automotive industry as well. A Senate committee led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, requested a hearing with CEOs from Ford, GM and Stellantis about affordability and other issues in the automotive industry. The hearing was scheduled for Jan. 14   amid scheduling conflicts and general pushback from Ford about   CEO Elon Musk not attending the meeting, according to a letter from the company to the subcommittee that  . Automakers are also bracing this year for potentially volatile U.S. regulations and trade negotiations, such as the   that's scheduled for later this year. Currently, automakers can import new   or Japan with lower tariffs than from Canada or Mexico, depending on their U.S. content. The Trump administration has reached trade deals on vehicles with those Asian countries but not its neighbors to the north and south.  Depending on the outcome of those discussions, USMCA could be a tailwind for automakers that have a lot of production in the U.S. \"Looking to 2026, our cycle work would suggest that autos would have a difficult time outperforming given a relatively flat y/y volume outlook. However, we see reasons for optimism for US [automakers],\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak wrote last month in an investor note.  Wall Street will begin getting its first outlooks from automakers this week beginning with GM announcing its fourth quarter and year-end earnings on Tuesday, followed by   on Wednesday.  GM CEO   earlier this month reconfirmed that the automaker expects  than 2025.   GM's 2025 guidance included adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of between $12 billion and $13 billion, or $9.75 to $10.50 adjusted EPS, and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10 billion to $11 billion, up from $7.5 billion to $10 billion. But depending on the automaker, Wall Street analysts expect mixed results for the U.S. industry as it continues to deal with uncertain times. \"It is hard to imagine how 2026 could bring more external shocks and share price divergence than 2025 but, with no visible end to industry disruption, we are also prepared for surprises, impairments and strategic shifts,\" Jefferies analyst Owen Paterson said in an investor note this month.",

                "full_text": "Moving between panels, hotel lobbies, and meetings this week, it often felt like two conferences were happening in the same snowy Swiss village. In one Davos, the mood was strikingly optimistic. Executives and investors spoke about artificial intelligence moving from hype to production, terms like \"  were being thrown around, with discussions about the enormous pools of capital ready to back it. In the other, a number of conversations seemed to end up back at tariffs, Greenland, geopolitical tensions, and a growing sense that the global rules investors have relied on for decades are shifting in real time. Both worlds overlapped constantly. Often, in the same conversation. \"What Davos highlighted this year is not a crisis of innovation, but a crisis of coherence and loss of trust,\" Chavalit Frederick Tsao, chairman of Singapore-based family-run trading business Tsao Pao Chee, said on the sidelines. \"Technology is advancing faster than our collective wisdom.\" That tension between swift innovation and political uncertainty defined much of the week. On Wednesday, thousands queued for more than an hour to hear U.S. President Donald Trump's address at the Congress Hall.  . Inside, the atmosphere felt more like a concert than a policy forum. Trump's speech swung between humor, provocation, and unpredictability. But when he turned to Greenland — insisting the U.S. needed to acquire the Arctic island — the mood in the room changed. People who laughed moments before turned quiet. Some shook their heads; others exchanged uneasy glances. In the next few hours,   and seemed to have moved on from AI infrastructure and energy investments to trade leverage and political risk. The very next day,  . In a packed session,  's CEO outlined an ambitious vision for robotaxis, humanoid robots, and AI development. He said Tesla's driverless robotaxis would be \"very, very widespread\" in the U.S. by the end of 2026. He also predicted AI could surpass human intelligence as soon as this year. For many attendees, it reset the mood. Afterward, conversations moved to data centers, battery storage, computing power, and how cities and grids will cope with the expected surge in demand for energy. The contrast with the day before was stark. One day, Davos was trying to understand the geopolitical implications of Trump's speech. Next, it was back to talking about the technological future at full speed. That whiplash kept showing up in interviews throughout the week. Waleed Al Mokarrab Al Muhairi, deputy CEO of Abu Dhabi-based investment giant Mubadala, told CNBC's Dan Murphy the investment stance into 2026 could be summed up in two words: \"conviction driven.\" \"So it's not chaotic, but the world is becoming more fragmented, without a doubt,\" he said. \"That will come with its own opportunity, but pitfalls as well … As long as you can deploy capital in a methodical, strategic, conviction-driven sort of manner, then I think you're going to be ahead of the pack\" Meanwhile, Joe Kaeser, chair of Siemens Energy, framed AI as an industrial opportunity rather than a race for consumers. \"There is no such continent in the world which has as much data on industrialization, mechanization, and automation as Europe,\" he told CNBC.  \"Combine that with computing power, and Europe has the best options to define where the physical and the virtual come together.\" Kaeser said leaders were still waiting to see whether policy announcements would translate into action. \"The jury is still out on whether things will be executed as announced,\" he said. \"But if one of the very important players is not willing to play, it's bad for everybody.\" For finance ministers and other policymakers, much of the Davos message this year was about reassurance. Enoch Godongwana, South Africa's finance minister, highlighted recent credit upgrades, his country's removal from the U.S. Financial Action Task Force's gray list, and political stability, before the conversation turned to managing ties with Washington and trade talks. \"The number one risk for South Africa's economy is the geopolitical situation,\" he told CNBC. \"It is difficult to predict, and we don't know its implications.\" Saudi Arabia's finance minister, Mohammed Al-Jadaan, returned repeatedly to the need for dialogue. \"What businesses need is certainty,\" he said, adding that disputes should be resolved through dialogue. By week's end, a clear pattern appeared. Panels on AI, the energy transition, and industrial reinvention were packed. Private discussions focused on expansion, deployment, and long-term prospects. But in less busy moments — over coffee, in corridors, on shuttles — the talk returned to Greenland, tariffs, and how swiftly policy could alter the investment calculus. One Davos focused on the tech frontier and what AI could unlock. The other focused on navigating geopolitical uncertainty and preserving the conditions that enable that progress. Both unfolded at the same time, in the same village, often in the same conversation.  Follow CNBC International on   and  .",

Musk saw his 2018 Tesla pay package -- now valued at over $130 billion --   in December, and his company SpaceX looks set to for a   in 2026. Those two events could well put Musk on his way to becoming the world's first trillionaire this year. In addition, his new pay package, valued at up to $1 trillion, could also start paying out over the next decade. While Musk may be an outlier, his stock-fueled gains highlight the booming compensation and wealth gains of CEOs in recent decades that has been driven by rising stock markets and a broader adoption of stock-centric pay packages  Over the past 50 years, top CEO compensation has  , according to the Economic Policy Institute. That compares to a   in typical worker compensation.  Median total compensation for S&P 500 CEO's was  , up nearly 10% from 2023, according to Equilar, a corporate analytics firm. CEOs now make   more than the average employee, up from a 186 to 1 ratio in 2023.  Driving the acceleration in CEO pay is a shift in the types of stock awards used to incentivize and reward corporate chiefs.  CEO compensation typically includes four categories: salaries, long-term incentives, short-term incentives and perks. Long-term and short-term incentives are largely stock awards, and make up far and away the largest portion of CEO compensation. Stock awards accounted for   in 2024, with the median value increasing 15% that year, according to Equilar.  Musk's trillion-dollar pay package, for instance, doesn't include any salary. The potential value of the $1 trillion would come entirely from stock awards pegged to various targets. For Musk to get the full payout, Tesla must hit key  , including certain market capitalization and operational achievements. He could still earn billions in stock even if Tesla doesn't meet all the targets. \"Milestone achievements built into CEO pay packages could be the norm in the future,\" said Amit Batish, senior director marketing at Equilar. Company boards and CEOs themselves say that because their pay is tied closely to stock performance, their compensation reflects the larger wealth created for shareholders. The CEO only does well if shareholders do well, they argue. If stocks plummet, CEO's can also see big pay drops.  Others others argue that CEO's have only a partial impact on their companies' share price. A   of top executive pay between 2006 and 2020 found a weak correlation between higher CEO pay and company performance.  \"This notion that the guy in the corner office is somehow almost single handedly responsible for company value, and everyone else is just little minions who don't contribute much of anything ... everyone can see that is not true,\" said Sarah Anderson, at the Institute for Policy Studies.  According to the 2021 MSCI study, average performing CEO's took home only 4% less in realized pay than top-performing CEOs. More importantly, CEO's with the lowest awarded pay saw the strongest returns for shareholders. \"When we measured pay and performance against CEO tenure, we found little evidence that high CEO pay achieved this lofty goal of CEO incentivization,\" according to MSCI, an investment research firm. Since the 1990s, company boards have  , which incentivize short-term performance, with stock awards, which boards argue are driven by longer-term incentives. Shareholders of publicly traded companies can now vote in an advisory capacity on CEO pay, known as \"say on pay\" votes, but company boards have final say when it comes to compensation packages. While restraining CEO pay has proven ineffective, given the natural \"ratcheting up\" of median CEO pay by board compensation committees, some economists advocate more stock awards for employees to help close the gap between employees and CEOs.  Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOPs, for instance, are qualified retirement plans that give employees shares in the company through a trust. Employees who can partake in ESOPs tend to end up with better financial security, said Loren Rodgers, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership. That in turn benefits their companies, he said.  \"Employee-owned businesses are more productive,\" Rodgers said. \"They're more able to recruit people. People quit at lower rates. They're more competitive.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article DAVOS, Switzerland — I spent the week talking to tech executives at the World Economic Forum in Davos about their priorities for the year ahead and the big themes they see shaping investor sentiment. Like last year, AI dominated the conference. But this year, the discussions went beyond AI models or which chatbot is better, shifting instead to how enterprises will adopt the technology and what future developments are on the horizon. All of these could be key to revenue and share prices of the world's biggest technology firms. Adoption of AI by businesses will increase this year, but the approach will differ markedly from 2025. Many companies were doing pilot projects with AI that didn't go into full production last year. Then, businesses were adopting AI, such as chatbots provided by  , OpenAI and others. There was a fear of missing out or FOMO, Dowson Tong, CEO of  's cloud group, told CNBC in an interview this week.  Instead, businesses will be more selective with the type of AI they're adopting. \"This year, when we talk to customers, I think they're being a lot more pragmatic. I think they've gone past the phase of FOMO,\" Tong said. \"And today, I think many of our customers are a lot more specific.\"  Raj Sharma, global managing partner for growth and innovation at EY, said businesses will need to reimagine whole processes that can be done with AI. \"That's when you will start seeing the value,\" Sharma told CNBC in an interview.  This was one of 2025's biggest buzzwords and is poised to stay front and center. Agentic AI broadly refers to the concept of AI systems that are able to carry out tasks on behalf of people. The ultimate goal is to have sophisticated agents that work autonomously with very little user interaction.  Technology executives told me that agents are being implemented, but there are varying degrees of scale and capabilities. It also really depends on which industry you're referring to. Some uses of agents within business are carrying out simple processes, while others are carrying out more sophisticated workflows.  \"I think these agents are not autonomous. I don't think we have reached the point where we can replace a human employee,\" Uljan Sharka, CEO of startup Domyn said.  The most bullish on the tech was Fabricio Bloisi, the CEO of Prosus. He said that Prosus has 30,000 agents currently running, and in the next five years there could be companies that are run by agents. \"I don't think it's a hype and hope,\" Bloisi said in an interview with CNBC's Dan Murphy and me this week.  The impact of geopolitical volatility was the subject of many of the conversations I had this week. \"One thing that we are not talking about in the AI world, and that will become a big issue, a big deterrent, or a big accelerant, is where the [geopolitical] issues are,\" EY's Sharma said.  China's tech advancements in areas such as AI and chips, were also among the talking points. In an interview for CNBC's new podcast, The Tech Downland, with Steve Kovach, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said he thinks China's AI models are   the U.S. and Western models.  Expect physical AI to be on the tech buzzword list this year. The term refers to applications where AI takes on a physical form, from robotics to driverless cars. My own experience at Davos highlighted just how real this push has become: one evening at dinner, a robot was sitting right at the table. EY's Sharma labeled physical AI the \"next wave,\" estimating it could be five to six times the market size of agentic AI within five to six years. Meanwhile, Sassine Ghazi, CEO of semiconductor design tool company Synopsys, said he initially expected phyiscal AI would come \"five plus\" years down the road, but it is coming \"much faster.\"  Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said AI robotics is a   opportunity for Europe as the region boasts an industrial manufacturing base that is \"incredibly strong.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article 's deprioritizing virtual reality in favor of artificial intelligence and Internet-connected smart glasses has chilled the industry, leading to concerns about its future.  \"I can see how it feels like a VR winter,\" said Jessica Young, an independent VR content creator specializing in Horizon Worlds, Meta's virtual social network.  The social media giant last week laid off 10% of employees who work within its Reality Labs unit, with the cuts centering on VR-related initiatives like the Quest VR headsets, CNBC  . Teams working on  Horizon Worlds were hit hard and some in-house studios were shuttered. Approximately 1,000 jobs were cut, CNBC reported.  The move was part of the company's effort to redirect Reality Labs investments from VR to AI and wearable devices like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses that are co-produced with , a spokesperson for the social media company said in a statement last week. Meta declined to comment further beyond its previous statement. Meta's reduced investment in VR is notable considering how much the company has helped grow the industry since its  in 2014. The company became synonymous with VR when CEO   changed its name from Facebook to Meta, representing the founder's obsession with a future of digital worlds referred to as the  . Since late 2020, Meta's   has logged over $70 billion in cumulative losses. Zuckerberg's sudden reversal has some VR developers worried about their future prospects. While they said they don't see Meta killing its VR efforts, a major shift appears to be underway.  Meta traditionally announces new Quest VR headsets during its annual Connect conference in the fall, but in 2025, the company skimped on VR hardware. Instead, Meta introduced its $799  that contain a single, built-in digital screen.  \"If Meta's not putting out a new headset for another year or two, it's going to feel stale,\" Young said. \"It already kind of does.\" Since the layoffs, Meta tech chief Andrew Bosworth has been vocal that the social media giant is not abandoning VR. \"We're still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we hoped,\" Bosworth told . \"And so you want to make sure that your investment is right-sized.\" Bosworth this week also circulated a post by Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey,   that Meta still employs the \"largest team working on VR by about an order of magnitude.\"  Although Luckey said that he feels \"really bad for the people impacted\" by the layoffs, the Reality Labs changes represent \"a good thing thing for the long-term health of the industry, especially the ongoing incentives.\" Market research firm IDC said in a December  that a major transition is occurring in the so-called Extended Reality, or XR, device segment. This category includes VR and so-called mixed-reality headsets that allow users to switch between virtual environments and see their surroundings outside the helmet. The category also counts AI-powered smart glasses and more powerful versions with digital displays. IDC projects the XR device category to have grown 41.6% year-over-year to 14.5 million units shipped for 2025. But that growth has nothing to do with VR and mixed-reality headsets — those shipments are expected to drop 42.8% to 3.9 million in 2025. The rest of this XR category, which includes AI glasses with and without displays, is projected to grow 211.2% year-over-year to 10.6 million units shipped for 2025. Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager for market analyst firm IDC, characterized the VR headset market as niche and appealing to only a small segment of video gamers. Average consumers seem uninterested in wearing \"big, bulky headsets\" for lengthy VR sessions like much of the tech industry hoped for roughly a decade ago, he said. \"The market has spoken,\" Ubrani said. \"There are certain niche audiences that will continue to use these headsets, but it's not going to be broadly appealing.\" Andrew Eiche, the CEO of the Google-owned VR gaming studio Owlchemy Labs, said it was always misguided to think VR was on the cusp of having its breakthrough smartphone moment. He called it a \"strategic mistake\" to compare VR headsets to iPhones  The VR market, Eiche said, more closely resembles old-school Atari video game consoles that were popular before sales crashed during an infamous . It wasn't until the late 1980s that Nintendo consoles helped revive the market, laying the groundwork for the overall industry to balloon to the massive sector it is today. \"Lot of tech people thought [VR] was going to be instantly amazing, and the same thing's happening with AI,\" Eiche said about the tech industry's pivot to the latest craze. \"When you're looking at long-term technologies, VR is not going anywhere.\" Still, Eiche said that beyond Meta's layoffs, other VR studios have also recently downsized as part of a broader . Because Quest is the dominant VR headset on the market, its app store is a key distribution channel for third-party VR. Making matters worse, Eiche said that Meta's Horizon Worlds push came at the expense of third-party developers who were trying to find visibility among Quest users. \"We're at the mercy of Meta,\" Eiche said, adding that it \"creates a situation where if Meta pulls back, we all pull back.\"  Eiche said he's optimistic that the upcoming Steam Frame wireless VR headset from gaming company   will help the market, as well as the recent entries of other devices like the  , which debuted in October, and   Vision Pro.  But Apple's   in February 2024 hasn't done much to move the needle, and in January, IDC said that Apple's Chinese manufacturing partner Luxshare stopped , signaling a lack of widespread consumer demand. Still, Ubrani said that Apple's $3,499 spatial computing headset has found some footing as a business tool. \"Apple did do well in selling to a lot of developers, but they also sold into some very big companies,\" Ubrani said. \"There were certain quarters where Apple beat Meta in enterprise,\" Ubrani said, due in part to the iPhone-maker's experience selling devices to businesses.  The enterprise VR market may not be as glamorous as its consumer counterpart, but it represents an area where IDC has \"seen slow but upwards movement, because companies are realizing that there is great ROI attached with deploying these headsets.\" As part of Meta's Reality Labs cuts, the company said in a  that it would end its Horizon managed services program that was for businesses that used Quest headsets for internal tasks like virtual employee trainings. Meta failed to realize \"how big VR could be if they adopted the bigger picture outside of gaming,\" said Sean Mann, CEO of the startup RP1, which develops a \"metaverse browser\" for people to access virtual and augmented reality environments.  As Meta downsizes its VR ambitions and steers Horizon Worlds to be a mobile-focused online gaming platform like  , Young said she plans to keep creating experiences on the platform.  Young has been able to make a living by getting paid by other Horizon developers to create trailers to promote experiences available to users on the service. She's also earned money from Meta by winning Horizon-related   intended to help improve the overall platform. But Young said she's less enthusiastic about Horizon's mobile push, because there was something special about the platform during its earlier, VR-centric years, particularly during the Covid era.  \"Horizon became a lifeline for people isolated by the pandemic, disability, age or geography,\" she said. \"Many users who never imagined themselves as creators, who had no background in art or programming, were inspired by their friends to try.\" But Horizon lost is way, and \"what's frustrating now is watching people declare it dead without ever having experienced or understanding what it was,\" Young said.  :",

                "full_text": "Every January, the world's most powerful people gather on the snowy peaks of Davos to talk about the most pressing global issues, and it's a masterclass in the art of communication and influence.  The World Economic Forum's flagship conference took place between 19-23 January, and leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, billionaire Bill Gates and   CEO Jensen Huang delivered speeches and spoke on panels.  This year's theme was \"A Spirit of Dialogue,\" as   dominated conversations.  Among the most important topics was Trump's insistence on taking ownership of the , as well as the impact of  on the labor market.  The responses of national leaders and CEOs were broadcast live, then distilled into 10-second soundbites and TikTok fan edits, consumed globally, and inviting instant critique. René Carayol, a leadership coach to Fortune 500 and FTSE 100 executives and world leaders, broke down what the most effective communicators did at this year's World Economic Forum, in a conversation with CNBC.  Carayol, who has worked with Nelson Mandela, former Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair,   CEO Tim Cook, and many more, was frank about the key ingredients to powerful public speaking and communication.  \"The two big things that we always coach: it's the performance, not the content. Second thing, it's not what you say, it's the way that you say it. That's the most powerful thing. Stop trying to remember the words, learn the performance,\" Carayol said.  French President Emmanuel Macron and Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney were \"two masterclasses\" in public speaking, leadership, and influence, according to Carayol.   in Davos on Tuesday, and in a hard-hitting speech, he hit back at \"bullies\" after Trump renewed threats of tariffs against Europe, as well as  , which have since been dropped.  The French leader warned of a world \"without rules\" as international law is being disregarded and called for global cooperation to address instability. This was all delivered with blue aviator-style sunglasses due to an eye infection, which Carayol said, lent a \"Tom Cruise\" feel to Macron's presentation.  \"He was like a Marvel superhero. He was stood up, forthright, as tall as he could be, and spoke out,\" Carayol said.  His stance was \"upright, looking up, looking powerful,\" which exuded an aura of being \"unafraid, unapologetic, and gave all of Europe backbone.\"  Carney delivered a similar message to Macron's in his own speech at the WEF on Tuesday, where he said the world's \"middle powers\" must unite against coercion from the world's largest. \"Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons. Tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,\" Carney said. Carayol said Carney's speech was \"brilliant\" and described him as calm, authoritative, measured, and studied.  Carney's facial expression did much of the talking as he remained \"extremely serious and grave\" throughout his speech and didn't break a smile once. He also used intonation to create gravitas.  \"He was serious ... he wanted the world to know that they are not backing down against Trump without ever mentioning him,\" Carayol said. \"Macron was the one you'd go away with and remember, Carney was the one you'd respect.\"  While Trump is generally a great speaker, Carayol said he gave a rambling  .  \"Trump was all over the show, off script, rambling, no real point, because he was doing his   Trump always chickens out when someone stands up to him,\" he said. \"He was a shriveled mess.\" However, Carayol noted that Trump is usually  \"brilliant\" and \"when he's on top form ... you won't agree with what he says, but the way he says it.\"  Carayol recalled the lead up to the U.S. Presidential elections in 2024: \"He's at his best when he's in a competitive environment. So when he was running for president, he slaughtered all the opposition.\" Business leaders may communicate differently from heads of state because CEOs must be more conscious of how their words affect their companies' stock prices, while world leaders can utilize stronger rhetoric, according to Andrew Brodsky, a management professor at the University of Texas and the author of  PING: The Secrets of Successful Communication.\" \"World leaders often have other communication tools at their disposal because they don't have to worry about a stock price,\" Brodsky told CNBC. \"Notably, world leaders use strategies like leveraging negative emotions, such as anger, and highlighting potential existential threats to their country's future to motivate their population.\" On the opposite end, if tech CEOs show a lot of \"negative emotion or dwell on the risks\" of technology like AI, then their company's stock price would likely be affected, or staff would lose trust in the company and leave.  Instead, Brodsky highlighted that one of the best communication styles in leadership is using \"imagery, metaphors, and stories\" to share a vision with audiences.  For example, when Satya Nadella discussed AI advancements at the WEF this week, he compared it to how transformational PCs were when they were first introduced and even noted that the impacts of AI are \"10x, 100x\" times that.  \"Rather than emphasize the technical elements, Nadella communicated his vision for the future of AI through using simple metaphors in a way anyone could understand,\" Brodsky said.  Additionally,   was asked about whether AI would increase or decrease the number of jobs, and instead of using statistics, he told a story about how AI actually increased the number of  .  \"Rather than relying on high-level cross-industry statistics, Huang was able to use a story about radiologists to show the positive impact of AI. By using a story, he was able to make what he was saying feel much more tangible and meaningful to the audience in a way that statistics by themselves simply can't,\" Brodsky said.  Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates also stood out during a panel, as he mostly maintained eye contact with the audience while being asked questions by interviewers and other panelists.  \"This seemingly small choice made it feel like Gates was speaking directly to the audience and bringing them into the conversation,\" Brodsky added.",

                "full_text": "In this article  and   VC arms have backed British AI startup Synthesia in a $200 million funding round, amid a surge of private investment in promising young tech companies seeking to capitalize on the AI boom. The round sees Synthesia hit a $4 billion valuation and was led by Alphabet's GV, with participation from Evantic, Hedosophia, Nvidia's NVentures, Accel, New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and Air Street Capital. It nearly doubles the price tag the startup hit a year ago, when it picked up $180 million in funding, and a valuation of $2.1 billion. Synthesia develops video generation tools for enterprises to be used for internal and external communications.  Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia's cofounder and CEO, in a statement, that the funding round was \"about scaling\" its vision of AI reducing the cost of content creation, and AI video providing \"a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn.\" \"We see a rare convergence of two major shifts: a technology shift with AI Agents becoming more capable, and a market shift where upskilling and internal knowledge sharing have become board-level priorities,\" he added. As part of the raise, Synthesia will facilitate an employee secondary share sale in partnership with NASDAQ at a $4 billion valuation. Europe's AI startups raised a record $21.4 billion in private funding in 2025, according to deal-counting platform Dealroom.  U.S. AI companies picked up $162.7 billion that year, but that includes around $70 billion raised by just three companies, OpenAI, Anthropic and xAI.  That momentum has continued in 2026. In recent weeks, CNBC reported that OpenAI is in talks with sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East for a round that could total  , Anthropic signed a term sheet for a new   and  Synthesia's fresh funding will see it double down on its rollout of agentic capabilities within the videos its AI creates, which allows users to interact with them in real time. The AI video means employees can explore scenarios through role-play and receive tailored explanations rather than passively consuming training materials, the company said. Founded in 2017, Synthesia has become one of the most talked-about AI startups in the UK tech sector and has courted politicians as it looks to expand. Both London Mayor Sadiq Khan and the then Tech Minister Peter Kyle were present for the company's new office opening in July. \"Synthesia is a UK success story, creating new jobs and opportunities in this country,\" said UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves. \"It shows that by backing innovators to start, scale and stay in the UK through better access to finance and generous tax reliefs, we can turn the promise of AI into better-paid jobs and long-term growth across the UK.\" Synthesia has hit $150 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and expects to pass the $200 million mark sometime in 2026, Chief Financial Officer Daniel Kim told CNBC.",

Tesla shares rose 4.2% on Thursday to close at $449.36. Tesla lags behind several companies that are already operating commercial robotaxi services with no drivers or safety monitors present.   Waymo leads the U.S. market, while   Apollo Go is out front in China with significant competition from  Other players are joining the fray, as   Zoox is now operating limited driverless services in the U.S., and startups like May Mobility and Nuro are developing their driverless offerings. Musk said in July that Tesla would likely have \"  ride hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year.\" The company fell far shy of that goal.  However, Tesla drummed up excitement with the launch of its Robotaxi ride-hailing app, and its initial services in Austin and the San Francisco Bay area. In Texas, Tesla obtained a permit to run a transportation networking company, which allowed it to use \"automated driving systems,\" or driverless vehicles, there. But in California, Tesla has yet to obtain permits that would allow it to conduct driverless testing or robotaxi rides without a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Musk said, \"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point,\" adding that he expects his company's Robotaxi service will be \"very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.\"  Musk is notorious for missing his self-imposed timelines for grand technical or business achievements. In 2019, he told investors that he   the company would be able to turn its existing vehicles into robotaxis with a software update by the end of the following year. With its EV sales sliding, Tesla's ability to keep investors enthused may hinge on whether it can scale a driverless, ride-hailing service in the U.S. this year and upgrade the partially automated driving systems in its cars to a fully automated driving system. Today, its premium system is marketed as FSD (Supervised), and the company plans to sell an FSD Unsupervised system in the future. Surveys by the   found a majority of U.S. consumers polled late last year did not want to ride in robotaxis, with particular concerns around safety. Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note this week that they anticipated \"muted underlying volume growth\" for Tesla and EV maker   this year with \"autonomy and physical AI driving the narrative.\" They also said, \"Tesla will have to prove out FSD unsupervised and the scaling up of robotaxi (which in our view has been clearly tracking behind schedule) before garnering incremental valuation credit.\"  Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Late last year, California regulators found that Tesla had engaged in deceptive marketing and   around their vehicles' driverless capabilities. And the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is   Tesla to determine how often the company's FSD systems may have caused traffic safety violations. According to  , which draws on NHTSA data, legal filings and press reports to track fatal Tesla collisions, 65 people have died in Tesla crashes that involved the use of Autopilot, including two in which the company's FSD systems were engaged in the seconds leading up to the crash.

                "full_text": "In this article A former official of U.S. President Donald Trump's first administration is planning a multi-billion-dollar data center project in a remote corner of Greenland, as hyperscalers scramble to build out capacity across the globe to keep up with the AI rollout. The data center is aiming to be operational at 300 megawatts (MW) by mid-2027, before further expansion would see it hit 1.5 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2028. While that's currently several times the power capacity of any active data center in the world, there are plans to   across the globe over the next two years as the race to develop AI infrastructure continues to gather pace. The Greenland data center project will cost billions of dollars to complete and has binding commitments with investors to finance half of its initial phase of development and half of the final phase, Drew Horn, a senior aide to Trump's first-term vice president Mike Pence and CEO of GreenMet, a company that's offering strategic support to the project, told CNBC.  The venture is eyeing a buildout in the Kangerlussuaq area, a small settlement at the end of a deep fjord on the southwest coast of the Arctic island, with an airport, he added. Technical partners have been enlisted to help with the physical buildout, but the project has yet to secure land or approvals from the local authorities, Horn said. He declined to share the names of the other companies involved in the venture because the information isn't public yet. Commercial opportunities in Greenland have been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks as the Arctic island has become the center of a geopolitical firestorm after U.S. President Donald Trump     and   have been touted as potential prospects, though skeptics point to logistical challenges around tapping into them with Greenland's limited infrastructure.   Data center deals hit a  in 2025 amid a rush to build out the infrastructure needed to power energy-intensive AI workloads. Big tech firms, including  , OpenAI,  ,  ,   and   are investing huge sums into developing facilities across the globe.  Work on plans for the Greenland data center project began a year ago, and Horn told CNBC it has secured technical partners to assist with construction, operation and supplying energy. Committed financing, which is in the form of debt and equity, is contingent on the project meeting key milestones, including securing permits from local government, said Horn — who was also a senior advisor to both the energy and intelligence departments towards the end of Trump's first term. Other former senior Trump employees also have stakes in GreenMet, which says on its website that it helps companies with government and private funding and strategic partnerships.   George Sorial, who was an executive vice president and chief compliance counsel at the Trump Organization until 2019, and Keith Schiller, who was a longtime bodyguard for Trump and director of Oval Office operations during the U.S. president's first term, helped set up the company in 2021 and remain shareholders. \"We are not actively involved with GreenMet or Greenland,\" Sorial told CNBC. \"We are passive minority shareholders in GreenMet and have no management role in the company.\" Schiller had not responded to a CNBC request for comment as this story went live. The GreenMet CEO has been developing relationships with officials in the Greenlandic and Danish administrations as he looks to advance the project. He met the Danish Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper Møller Sørensen on Wednesday, as part of a \"continuing dialogue,\" to discuss the data center, Horn said. CNBC has approached Denmark's U.S. embassy for comment. While officials on all sides have been supportive of the project, the \"issue is not so much on the private side, it's on the diplomatic,\" Horn said, pointing to the geopolitical tensions surrounding the U.S. push to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory. Tensions have cooled since Trump backtracked on plans to impose tariffs on several European nations over the issue, but   as negotiations around U.S. military and economic involvement in Greenland continue. \"Our effort, which is purely private, it succeeds only if we have the buy-in from the relevant affected parties and countries,\" Horn said. \"Larger corporate entities\" will be taking the lead on the construction and development of the data center, but GreenMet will continue to be involved as an advisor as the project looks to secure government investment from nations including the U.S., Greenland, Denmark, and other NATO countries, Horn told CNBC.  \"We've spent about a year putting together everything from the power to the technology components, [and] we have a Greenlandic partner on the ground,\" Horn said. \"Right now we're waiting on approvals from the Greenlandic side.\" A big challenge for projects of this scale in Greenland is access to power. For the first phase of the project, which is targeting 300 MW power capacity, the plan is to use specialized barges carrying Liquefied Natural Gas to the fjord, Horn said. The venture plans to build a hydroelectric facility — 70% of the island's energy comes from such facilities — to power the second phase, which would see the data center hit 1.5 GW capacity. Permits and approvals from the Greenlandic government are still pending for both the barges and the facility. Greenland's Ministry of Business has been approached for comment. Horn argues that if local authorities greenlight the large hydroelectric facility, energy prices will make the project commercially viable long-term.  There are some significant advantages to building data centers in an environment with low temperatures, analysts told CNBC. \"The biggest value sits in its resource profile, specifically in hydro for electricity generation and a 'free cooling' proposition given the lower ambient temperature,\" Noah Ramos, strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, told CNBC. But there are hurdles the project will have to overcome. \"Building in the Arctic is capital intensive; construction seasons are short, and the heat from the servers can melt the very ground the building sits on... specialized engineering is needed,\" Ramos said.  is also touting a new generation of chips that require less cooling. \"It's early days, but if future generations of chips are even more efficient in this regard, it could negate the need for expensive data centre build outs in places like Greenland,\" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC.",

Tesla shares rose 4.2% on Thursday to close at $449.36. Tesla lags behind several companies that are already operating commercial robotaxi services with no drivers or safety monitors present.   Waymo leads the U.S. market, while   Apollo Go is out front in China with significant competition from  Other players are joining the fray, as   Zoox is now operating limited driverless services in the U.S., and startups like May Mobility and Nuro are developing their driverless offerings. Musk said in July that Tesla would likely have \"  ride hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year.\" The company fell far shy of that goal.  However, Tesla drummed up excitement with the launch of its Robotaxi ride-hailing app, and its initial services in Austin and the San Francisco Bay area. In Texas, Tesla obtained a permit to run a transportation networking company, which allowed it to use \"automated driving systems,\" or driverless vehicles, there. But in California, Tesla has yet to obtain permits that would allow it to conduct driverless testing or robotaxi rides without a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Musk said, \"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point,\" adding that he expects his company's Robotaxi service will be \"very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.\"  Musk is notorious for missing his self-imposed timelines for grand technical or business achievements. In 2019, he told investors that he   the company would be able to turn its existing vehicles into robotaxis with a software update by the end of the following year. With its EV sales sliding, Tesla's ability to keep investors enthused may hinge on whether it can scale a driverless, ride-hailing service in the U.S. this year and upgrade the partially automated driving systems in its cars to a fully automated driving system. Today, its premium system is marketed as FSD (Supervised), and the company plans to sell an FSD Unsupervised system in the future. Surveys by the   found a majority of U.S. consumers polled late last year did not want to ride in robotaxis, with particular concerns around safety. Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note this week that they anticipated \"muted underlying volume growth\" for Tesla and EV maker   this year with \"autonomy and physical AI driving the narrative.\" They also said, \"Tesla will have to prove out FSD unsupervised and the scaling up of robotaxi (which in our view has been clearly tracking behind schedule) before garnering incremental valuation credit.\"  Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Late last year, California regulators found that Tesla had engaged in deceptive marketing and   around their vehicles' driverless capabilities. And the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is   Tesla to determine how often the company's FSD systems may have caused traffic safety violations. According to  , which draws on NHTSA data, legal filings and press reports to track fatal Tesla collisions, 65 people have died in Tesla crashes that involved the use of Autopilot, including two in which the company's FSD systems were engaged in the seconds leading up to the crash. Tesla is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.",

                "full_text": "In this article A former official of U.S. President Donald Trump's first administration is planning a multi-billion-dollar data center project in a remote corner of Greenland, as hyperscalers scramble to build out capacity across the globe to keep up with the AI rollout. The data center is aiming to be operational at 300 megawatts (MW) by mid-2027, before further expansion would see it hit 1.5 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2028. While that's currently several times the power capacity of any active data center in the world, there are plans to   across the globe over the next two years as the race to develop AI infrastructure continues to gather pace. The Greenland data center project will cost billions of dollars to complete and has binding commitments with investors to finance half of its initial phase of development and half of the final phase, Drew Horn, a senior aide to Trump's first-term vice president Mike Pence and CEO of GreenMet, a company that's offering strategic support to the project, told CNBC.  The venture is eyeing a buildout in the Kangerlussuaq area, a small settlement at the end of a deep fjord on the southwest coast of the Arctic island, with an airport, he added. Technical partners have been enlisted to help with the physical buildout, but the project has yet to secure land or approvals from the local authorities, Horn said. He declined to share the names of the other companies involved in the venture because the information isn't public yet. Commercial opportunities in Greenland have been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks as the Arctic island has become the center of a geopolitical firestorm after U.S. President Donald Trump     and   have been touted as potential prospects, though skeptics point to logistical challenges around tapping into them with Greenland's limited infrastructure.   Data center deals hit a  in 2025 amid a rush to build out the infrastructure needed to power energy-intensive AI workloads. Big tech firms, including  , OpenAI,  ,  ,   and   are investing huge sums into developing facilities across the globe.  Work on plans for the Greenland data center project began a year ago, and Horn told CNBC it has secured technical partners to assist with construction, operation and supplying energy. Committed financing, which is in the form of debt and equity, is contingent on the project meeting key milestones, including securing permits from local government, said Horn — who was also a senior advisor to both the energy and intelligence departments towards the end of Trump's first term. Other former senior Trump employees also have stakes in GreenMet, which says on its website that it helps companies with government and private funding and strategic partnerships.   George Sorial, who was an executive vice president and chief compliance counsel at the Trump Organization until 2019, and Keith Schiller, who was a longtime bodyguard for Trump and director of Oval Office operations during the U.S. president's first term, helped set up the company in 2021 and remain shareholders. \"We are not actively involved with GreenMet or Greenland,\" Sorial told CNBC. \"We are passive minority shareholders in GreenMet and have no management role in the company.\" Schiller had not responded to a CNBC request for comment as this story went live. The GreenMet CEO has been developing relationships with officials in the Greenlandic and Danish administrations as he looks to advance the project. He met the Danish Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper Møller Sørensen on Wednesday, as part of a \"continuing dialogue,\" to discuss the data center, Horn said. CNBC has approached Denmark's U.S. embassy for comment. While officials on all sides have been supportive of the project, the \"issue is not so much on the private side, it's on the diplomatic,\" Horn said, pointing to the geopolitical tensions surrounding the U.S. push to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory. Tensions have cooled since Trump backtracked on plans to impose tariffs on several European nations over the issue, but   as negotiations around U.S. military and economic involvement in Greenland continue. \"Our effort, which is purely private, it succeeds only if we have the buy-in from the relevant affected parties and countries,\" Horn said. \"Larger corporate entities\" will be taking the lead on the construction and development of the data center, but GreenMet will continue to be involved as an advisor as the project looks to secure government investment from nations including the U.S., Greenland, Denmark, and other NATO countries, Horn told CNBC.  \"We've spent about a year putting together everything from the power to the technology components, [and] we have a Greenlandic partner on the ground,\" Horn said. \"Right now we're waiting on approvals from the Greenlandic side.\" A big challenge for projects of this scale in Greenland is access to power. For the first phase of the project, which is targeting 300 MW power capacity, the plan is to use specialized barges carrying Liquefied Natural Gas to the fjord, Horn said. The venture plans to build a hydroelectric facility — 70% of the island's energy comes from such facilities — to power the second phase, which would see the data center hit 1.5 GW capacity. Permits and approvals from the Greenlandic government are still pending for both the barges and the facility. Greenland's Ministry of Business has been approached for comment. Horn argues that if local authorities greenlight the large hydroelectric facility, energy prices will make the project commercially viable long-term.  There are some significant advantages to building data centers in an environment with low temperatures, analysts told CNBC. \"The biggest value sits in its resource profile, specifically in hydro for electricity generation and a 'free cooling' proposition given the lower ambient temperature,\" Noah Ramos, strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, told CNBC. But there are hurdles the project will have to overcome. \"Building in the Arctic is capital intensive; construction seasons are short, and the heat from the servers can melt the very ground the building sits on... specialized engineering is needed,\" Ramos said.  is also touting a new generation of chips that require less cooling. \"It's early days, but if future generations of chips are even more efficient in this regard, it could negate the need for expensive data centre build outs in places like Greenland,\" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC.",

                "full_text": "In this article 's deprioritizing virtual reality in favor of artificial intelligence and Internet-connected smart glasses has chilled the industry, leading to concerns about its future.  \"I can see how it feels like a VR winter,\" said Jessica Young, an independent VR content creator specializing in Horizon Worlds, Meta's virtual social network.  The social media giant last week laid off 10% of employees who work within its Reality Labs unit, with the cuts centering on VR-related initiatives like the Quest VR headsets, CNBC  . Teams working on  Horizon Worlds were hit hard and some in-house studios were shuttered. Approximately 1,000 jobs were cut, CNBC reported.  The move was part of the company's effort to redirect Reality Labs investments from VR to AI and wearable devices like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses that are co-produced with , a spokesperson for the social media company said in a statement last week. Meta declined to comment further beyond its previous statement. Meta's reduced investment in VR is notable considering how much the company has helped grow the industry since its  in 2014. The company became synonymous with VR when CEO   changed its name from Facebook to Meta, representing the founder's obsession with a future of digital worlds referred to as the  . Since late 2020, Meta's   has logged over $70 billion in cumulative losses. Zuckerberg's sudden reversal has some VR developers worried about their future prospects. While they said they don't see Meta killing its VR efforts, a major shift appears to be underway.  Meta traditionally announces new Quest VR headsets during its annual Connect conference in the fall, but in 2025, the company skimped on VR hardware. Instead, Meta introduced its $799  that contain a single, built-in digital screen.  \"If Meta's not putting out a new headset for another year or two, it's going to feel stale,\" Young said. \"It already kind of does.\" Since the layoffs, Meta tech chief Andrew Bosworth has been vocal that the social media giant is not abandoning VR. \"We're still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we hoped,\" Bosworth told . \"And so you want to make sure that your investment is right-sized.\" Bosworth this week also circulated a post by Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey,   that Meta still employs the \"largest team working on VR by about an order of magnitude.\"  Although Luckey said that he feels \"really bad for the people impacted\" by the layoffs, the Reality Labs changes represent \"a good thing thing for the long-term health of the industry, especially the ongoing incentives.\" Market research firm IDC said in a December  that a major transition is occurring in the so-called Extended Reality, or XR, device segment. This category includes VR and so-called mixed-reality headsets that allow users to switch between virtual environments and see their surroundings outside the helmet. The category also counts AI-powered smart glasses and more powerful versions with digital displays. IDC projects the XR device category to have grown 41.6% year-over-year to 14.5 million units shipped for 2025. But that growth has nothing to do with VR and mixed-reality headsets — those shipments are expected to drop 42.8% to 3.9 million in 2025. The rest of this XR category, which includes AI glasses with and without displays, is projected to grow 211.2% year-over-year to 10.6 million units shipped for 2025. Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager for market analyst firm IDC, characterized the VR headset market as niche and appealing to only a small segment of video gamers. Average consumers seem uninterested in wearing \"big, bulky headsets\" for lengthy VR sessions like much of the tech industry hoped for roughly a decade ago, he said. \"The market has spoken,\" Ubrani said. \"There are certain niche audiences that will continue to use these headsets, but it's not going to be broadly appealing.\" Andrew Eiche, the CEO of the Google-owned VR gaming studio Owlchemy Labs, said it was always misguided to think VR was on the cusp of having its breakthrough smartphone moment. He called it a \"strategic mistake\" to compare VR headsets to iPhones  The VR market, Eiche said, more closely resembles old-school Atari video game consoles that were popular before sales crashed during an infamous . It wasn't until the late 1980s that Nintendo consoles helped revive the market, laying the groundwork for the overall industry to balloon to the massive sector it is today. \"Lot of tech people thought [VR] was going to be instantly amazing, and the same thing's happening with AI,\" Eiche said about the tech industry's pivot to the latest craze. \"When you're looking at long-term technologies, VR is not going anywhere.\" Still, Eiche said that beyond Meta's layoffs, other VR studios have also recently downsized as part of a broader . Because Quest is the dominant VR headset on the market, its app store is a key distribution channel for third-party VR. Making matters worse, Eiche said that Meta's Horizon Worlds push came at the expense of third-party developers who were trying to find visibility among Quest users. \"We're at the mercy of Meta,\" Eiche said, adding that it \"creates a situation where if Meta pulls back, we all pull back.\"  Eiche said he's optimistic that the upcoming Steam Frame wireless VR headset from gaming company   will help the market, as well as the recent entries of other devices like the  , which debuted in October, and   Vision Pro.  But Apple's   in February 2024 hasn't done much to move the needle, and in January, IDC said that Apple's Chinese manufacturing partner Luxshare stopped , signaling a lack of widespread consumer demand. Still, Ubrani said that Apple's $3,499 spatial computing headset has found some footing as a business tool. \"Apple did do well in selling to a lot of developers, but they also sold into some very big companies,\" Ubrani said. \"There were certain quarters where Apple beat Meta in enterprise,\" Ubrani said, due in part to the iPhone-maker's experience selling devices to businesses.  The enterprise VR market may not be as glamorous as its consumer counterpart, but it represents an area where IDC has \"seen slow but upwards movement, because companies are realizing that there is great ROI attached with deploying these headsets.\" As part of Meta's Reality Labs cuts, the company said in a  that it would end its Horizon managed services program that was for businesses that used Quest headsets for internal tasks like virtual employee trainings. Meta failed to realize \"how big VR could be if they adopted the bigger picture outside of gaming,\" said Sean Mann, CEO of the startup RP1, which develops a \"metaverse browser\" for people to access virtual and augmented reality environments.  As Meta downsizes its VR ambitions and steers Horizon Worlds to be a mobile-focused online gaming platform like  , Young said she plans to keep creating experiences on the platform.  Young has been able to make a living by getting paid by other Horizon developers to create trailers to promote experiences available to users on the service. She's also earned money from Meta by winning Horizon-related   intended to help improve the overall platform. But Young said she's less enthusiastic about Horizon's mobile push, because there was something special about the platform during its earlier, VR-centric years, particularly during the Covid era.  \"Horizon became a lifeline for people isolated by the pandemic, disability, age or geography,\" she said. \"Many users who never imagined themselves as creators, who had no background in art or programming, were inspired by their friends to try.\" But Horizon lost is way, and \"what's frustrating now is watching people declare it dead without ever having experienced or understanding what it was,\" Young said.  :",

                "full_text": "Every January, the world's most powerful people gather on the snowy peaks of Davos to talk about the most pressing global issues, and it's a masterclass in the art of communication and influence.  The World Economic Forum's flagship conference took place between 19-23 January, and leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, billionaire Bill Gates and   CEO Jensen Huang delivered speeches and spoke on panels.  This year's theme was \"A Spirit of Dialogue,\" as   dominated conversations.  Among the most important topics was Trump's insistence on taking ownership of the , as well as the impact of  on the labor market.  The responses of national leaders and CEOs were broadcast live, then distilled into 10-second soundbites and TikTok fan edits, consumed globally, and inviting instant critique. René Carayol, a leadership coach to Fortune 500 and FTSE 100 executives and world leaders, broke down what the most effective communicators did at this year's World Economic Forum, in a conversation with CNBC.  Carayol, who has worked with Nelson Mandela, former Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair,   CEO Tim Cook, and many more, was frank about the key ingredients to powerful public speaking and communication.  \"The two big things that we always coach: it's the performance, not the content. Second thing, it's not what you say, it's the way that you say it. That's the most powerful thing. Stop trying to remember the words, learn the performance,\" Carayol said.  French President Emmanuel Macron and Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney were \"two masterclasses\" in public speaking, leadership, and influence, according to Carayol.   in Davos on Tuesday, and in a hard-hitting speech, he hit back at \"bullies\" after Trump renewed threats of tariffs against Europe, as well as  , which have since been dropped.  The French leader warned of a world \"without rules\" as international law is being disregarded and called for global cooperation to address instability. This was all delivered with blue aviator-style sunglasses due to an eye infection, which Carayol said, lent a \"Tom Cruise\" feel to Macron's presentation.  \"He was like a Marvel superhero. He was stood up, forthright, as tall as he could be, and spoke out,\" Carayol said.  His stance was \"upright, looking up, looking powerful,\" which exuded an aura of being \"unafraid, unapologetic, and gave all of Europe backbone.\"  Carney delivered a similar message to Macron's in his own speech at the WEF on Tuesday, where he said the world's \"middle powers\" must unite against coercion from the world's largest. \"Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons. Tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,\" Carney said. Carayol said Carney's speech was \"brilliant\" and described him as calm, authoritative, measured, and studied.  Carney's facial expression did much of the talking as he remained \"extremely serious and grave\" throughout his speech and didn't break a smile once. He also used intonation to create gravitas.  \"He was serious ... he wanted the world to know that they are not backing down against Trump without ever mentioning him,\" Carayol said. \"Macron was the one you'd go away with and remember, Carney was the one you'd respect.\"  While Trump is generally a great speaker, Carayol said he gave a rambling  .  \"Trump was all over the show, off script, rambling, no real point, because he was doing his   Trump always chickens out when someone stands up to him,\" he said. \"He was a shriveled mess.\" However, Carayol noted that Trump is usually  \"brilliant\" and \"when he's on top form ... you won't agree with what he says, but the way he says it.\"  Carayol recalled the lead up to the U.S. Presidential elections in 2024: \"He's at his best when he's in a competitive environment. So when he was running for president, he slaughtered all the opposition.\" Business leaders may communicate differently from heads of state because CEOs must be more conscious of how their words affect their companies' stock prices, while world leaders can utilize stronger rhetoric, according to Andrew Brodsky, a management professor at the University of Texas and the author of  PING: The Secrets of Successful Communication.\" \"World leaders often have other communication tools at their disposal because they don't have to worry about a stock price,\" Brodsky told CNBC. \"Notably, world leaders use strategies like leveraging negative emotions, such as anger, and highlighting potential existential threats to their country's future to motivate their population.\" On the opposite end, if tech CEOs show a lot of \"negative emotion or dwell on the risks\" of technology like AI, then their company's stock price would likely be affected, or staff would lose trust in the company and leave.  Instead, Brodsky highlighted that one of the best communication styles in leadership is using \"imagery, metaphors, and stories\" to share a vision with audiences.  For example, when Satya Nadella discussed AI advancements at the WEF this week, he compared it to how transformational PCs were when they were first introduced and even noted that the impacts of AI are \"10x, 100x\" times that.  \"Rather than emphasize the technical elements, Nadella communicated his vision for the future of AI through using simple metaphors in a way anyone could understand,\" Brodsky said.  Additionally,   was asked about whether AI would increase or decrease the number of jobs, and instead of using statistics, he told a story about how AI actually increased the number of  .  \"Rather than relying on high-level cross-industry statistics, Huang was able to use a story about radiologists to show the positive impact of AI. By using a story, he was able to make what he was saying feel much more tangible and meaningful to the audience in a way that statistics by themselves simply can't,\" Brodsky said.  Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates also stood out during a panel, as he mostly maintained eye contact with the audience while being asked questions by interviewers and other panelists.  \"This seemingly small choice made it feel like Gates was speaking directly to the audience and bringing them into the conversation,\" Brodsky added.",
