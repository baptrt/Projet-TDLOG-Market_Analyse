        "full_text": "Lithium and steel outshined A.I. in 2025, at least when it comes to CNBC's exclusive Power City Indexes. The Power City Indexes (PCI) were built ten years ago. The 'indexes' are made up from the 11 or 12 largest market cap companies in 36 different city and metro areas around America.  The stocks are equally weighted in each index and tracked through the year on FactSet. The PCIs are an easy and exclusive way to find out which city or metro area is \"winning\" the stock market.   We highlight them through the year on CNBC and also bring them to you on CNBC Pro. They are meant more for fun, but we take them seriously.    Here's how we do it.  We base the city location on a company's headquarter location via a stock screener on S&P CapitalIQ.  Even if a company has more people in a different area, it is the location of the headquarters that matters for the PCI.  We use the median return for all 11 or 12 stocks.  And if a company is bought, the stock stays in the index until it delists, and then is replaced by the next largest company. Formalities now out of the way, let's have some fun and look at the median return for each region. The third best metro area for the stock market in 2025 was around our nation's capital.   Washington, D.C. listed companies — which includes those based in the city itself and those in the surrounding Virginia and Maryland suburbs — posted a solid year.  Defense contractors were an offensive play for investors, with  ,  ,   and  ) all popping.    It wasn't that long ago that all of these companies would've been represented in a different city's index, but over the past decade or so, they've all moved to be closer to the Pentagon and halls of power.   and   were some non-defense standouts for the D.C. PCI, which came in with about a 17% median return. Coming in second in our 2025 Power City Index ranking: Silicon Valley.   Given the hope and hype around A.I., perhaps the only real surprise here was that the metro area's market didn't win the whole thing.  Still, it was a nice year for investors up and down the US 101 corridor.   ,  ,  ,   and a company you may have heard about once or twice on CNBC this year –   – rocked it and powered the index to a 21%-plus median return.  If it wasn't for the more than 27% drop in shares of  , the Valley may have ruled the year. The biggest winner in 2025 goes to the Queen City of Charlotte, North Carolina.    The Charlotte PCI rose more than 22%, topping big tech by just over half a percent. Charlotte didn't have one stock that doubled, but it had seven big companies see their stocks rise more than 20%, pushing up the median return.  Big gains in lithium miner  , aerospace company  ,  ,   and   were the secret sauce to Charlotte's success this year and drove the area to victory in 2025 (a reference to the area's heavy NASCAR presence).    So a big congratulations and happy new year to Charlotte for having its Power City Index win the year in 2025.  We look forward to visiting soon.  Maybe even for the Panthers playoff game. And while we like to stay positive, it would be remiss to not note that the \"Big D\" stood for \"dud\" in 2025.   The worst performing Power City Index belonged to Dallas, Texas, with a median return of negative 10%.   Dallas has a lot of good things going for it, but the stock market wasn't one of them this year.    We look forward to following the country and its regional stock markets again next year.   Who knows, maybe we will even show up and do some CNBC TV from whichever region takes the crown.",

        "full_text": "In this article Valuations of several technology and artificial intelligence stocks are expected to remain in focus in 2026, as investors are concerned about the payoffs on massive AI spending. Nonetheless, top Wall Street analysts continue to be bullish on several tech and AI plays based on thorough analysis of their fundamentals, strong execution, and growth potential. Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is e-commerce and cloud computing giant   ( ). In a research note on the 2026 outlook for stocks in the AI and internet space, RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson called Amazon one of his favorite ideas, citing \"Best in-class visibility on AI infrastructure ROIC [return on invested capital] with compelling product cycle/capacity acceleration cycle coming.\" Erickson reaffirmed a buy rating on Amazon stock with a  . Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AMZN stock with an \"outperform\" rating but a lower price target of $240. The top-rated analyst said that he likes the structural positioning of the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit for two key reasons. First, Erickson highlighted that AWS has the most diversified and hedged revenue sources, with its core business largely unaffected by generative AI and not a competitor of ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Second, Erickson thinks that AWS is the most disciplined hyperscaler when it comes to capital spending. Notably, based on his ROIC scenario analysis, Erickson expects Amazon to see the fastest returns, with  -owned Google expanding more gradually, and   lagging in capital efficiency due to its indirect revenue model. He expects AWS to have the highest marginal contribution margin as the cloud unit increases its spending, thanks to its pay-as-you-go model and strong efficiency, with new capacity that is often pre-booked and revenue that is directly linked to infrastructure usage. Based on his optimistic outlook, Erickson raised his revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) estimates for 2026 and 2027, driven by higher AWS growth expectations and cost efficiencies. For 2028, the analyst expects revenue growth of 10% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%. Erickson ranks No. 195 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 21.9%.  Let's look at another tech giant,   ( ). Following meetings with the company's executives across businesses, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterated a buy rating on MSFT stock with a  . The stock scores an \"outperform\" rating from TipRanks' AI Analyst with a price target of $562. \"Meeting with executives across Microsoft businesses leaves us with conviction on robust demand translating to durable mid-teens top-line growth and increased confidence in ROI contributing to continued operating margin expansion,\" said Weiss. Among the key takeaways from his meetings that he mentioned, Weiss highlighted that demand for Microsoft Azure has been stronger than what the company expected at the start of the year. The analyst added that demand is solid not only for Azure AI but across every product within the Azure portfolio, thanks to broader IT modernization efforts of enterprises. Consequently, Weiss raised his Azure estimates, assuming Azure AI gross margin (excluding OpenAI revenue share) reaches 30% by fiscal 2029. In fact, Weiss thinks that Azure AI margin can exceed 40%, suggesting huge upside to his estimates in the years ahead. Overall, Weiss called MSFT his Top Pick in the large-cap software sector, with the stock trading at 23x his calendar year 2027 GAAP EPS estimate of $20.65. The analyst contends that sustained top-line demand and the possibility for further margin expansion, as reflected in the company's Q1 FY26 results, are not yet fully valued by the market. Weiss ranks No. 400 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.1%.  Memory and storage solutions provider   ( ) impressed investors with market-beating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. The company also issued an upbeat outlook for the fiscal second quarter, reflecting strong demand for its high-performance memory and storage products amid the rapid growth in AI data centers. Impressed by the Q1 FY26 print, Stifel analyst Brian Chin reiterated a buy rating on Micron stock with a  . TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on MU stock, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $285. Discussing the \"blockbuster\" quarterly performance and outlook, Chin observed that Micron easily surpassed Stifel's above-consensus expectations with a higher average selling price (ASP) driving a 20% sequential growth in DRAM and NAND revenue. The 5-star analyst highlighted the robust demand, saying, \"Demand is outstripping supply, with Micron only able to meet 1/2 to 2/3 of some key customers' near term demand.\" Chin also noted the impressive rise in margins across all of Micron's business units, including the consumer-oriented Mobile and Client Business division, which saw its gross margin jump to 54% in Q1 FY26 from 36% in Q4 FY25. The analyst also discussed Micron's solid guidance and added that despite industry supply constraints, Micron expects both DRAM and NAND bit shipments to increase by 20% in 2026. Overall, Chin remains bullish on MU stock and noted that after another round of positive estimate revisions, the stock trades at less than 6x his next-12 months earnings per share estimate. Chin ranks No. 350 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 25.6%.",

        "full_text": "In this article Valuations of several technology and artificial intelligence stocks are expected to remain in focus in 2026, as investors are concerned about the payoffs on massive AI spending. Nonetheless, top Wall Street analysts continue to be bullish on several tech and AI plays based on thorough analysis of their fundamentals, strong execution, and growth potential. Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is e-commerce and cloud computing giant   ( ). In a research note on the 2026 outlook for stocks in the AI and internet space, RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson called Amazon one of his favorite ideas, citing \"Best in-class visibility on AI infrastructure ROIC [return on invested capital] with compelling product cycle/capacity acceleration cycle coming.\" Erickson reaffirmed a buy rating on Amazon stock with a  . Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AMZN stock with an \"outperform\" rating but a lower price target of $240. The top-rated analyst said that he likes the structural positioning of the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit for two key reasons. First, Erickson highlighted that AWS has the most diversified and hedged revenue sources, with its core business largely unaffected by generative AI and not a competitor of ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Second, Erickson thinks that AWS is the most disciplined hyperscaler when it comes to capital spending. Notably, based on his ROIC scenario analysis, Erickson expects Amazon to see the fastest returns, with  -owned Google expanding more gradually, and   lagging in capital efficiency due to its indirect revenue model. He expects AWS to have the highest marginal contribution margin as the cloud unit increases its spending, thanks to its pay-as-you-go model and strong efficiency, with new capacity that is often pre-booked and revenue that is directly linked to infrastructure usage. Based on his optimistic outlook, Erickson raised his revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) estimates for 2026 and 2027, driven by higher AWS growth expectations and cost efficiencies. For 2028, the analyst expects revenue growth of 10% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%. Erickson ranks No. 195 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 21.9%.  Let's look at another tech giant,   ( ). Following meetings with the company's executives across businesses, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterated a buy rating on MSFT stock with a  . The stock scores an \"outperform\" rating from TipRanks' AI Analyst with a price target of $562. \"Meeting with executives across Microsoft businesses leaves us with conviction on robust demand translating to durable mid-teens top-line growth and increased confidence in ROI contributing to continued operating margin expansion,\" said Weiss. Among the key takeaways from his meetings that he mentioned, Weiss highlighted that demand for Microsoft Azure has been stronger than what the company expected at the start of the year. The analyst added that demand is solid not only for Azure AI but across every product within the Azure portfolio, thanks to broader IT modernization efforts of enterprises. Consequently, Weiss raised his Azure estimates, assuming Azure AI gross margin (excluding OpenAI revenue share) reaches 30% by fiscal 2029. In fact, Weiss thinks that Azure AI margin can exceed 40%, suggesting huge upside to his estimates in the years ahead. Overall, Weiss called MSFT his Top Pick in the large-cap software sector, with the stock trading at 23x his calendar year 2027 GAAP EPS estimate of $20.65. The analyst contends that sustained top-line demand and the possibility for further margin expansion, as reflected in the company's Q1 FY26 results, are not yet fully valued by the market. Weiss ranks No. 400 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.1%.  Memory and storage solutions provider   ( ) impressed investors with market-beating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. The company also issued an upbeat outlook for the fiscal second quarter, reflecting strong demand for its high-performance memory and storage products amid the rapid growth in AI data centers. Impressed by the Q1 FY26 print, Stifel analyst Brian Chin reiterated a buy rating on Micron stock with a  . TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on MU stock, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $285. Discussing the \"blockbuster\" quarterly performance and outlook, Chin observed that Micron easily surpassed Stifel's above-consensus expectations with a higher average selling price (ASP) driving a 20% sequential growth in DRAM and NAND revenue. The 5-star analyst highlighted the robust demand, saying, \"Demand is outstripping supply, with Micron only able to meet 1/2 to 2/3 of some key customers' near term demand.\" Chin also noted the impressive rise in margins across all of Micron's business units, including the consumer-oriented Mobile and Client Business division, which saw its gross margin jump to 54% in Q1 FY26 from 36% in Q4 FY25. The analyst also discussed Micron's solid guidance and added that despite industry supply constraints, Micron expects both DRAM and NAND bit shipments to increase by 20% in 2026. Overall, Chin remains bullish on MU stock and noted that after another round of positive estimate revisions, the stock trades at less than 6x his next-12 months earnings per share estimate. Chin ranks No. 350 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 25.6%.",

        "full_text": "West Texas dust, iron-tinged and orange-red, rides the wind and sticks like a film to everything you touch. It clings to skin and the inside of your mouth, a fine grit that turns every breath into a reminder of where you are. This is the landscape where OpenAI CEO   is orchestrating something called Stargate — a  , backed by partners including  ,  , and  . Some 6,000 workers' vehicles pour into the site each morning. Tires raise a constant veil of silt over a construction footprint the size of a small city — more people working this single campus than OpenAI employs across its entire payroll. Rain comes in flashes. One minute the roads are powder; the next they're mud — thick, adhesive, the kind that tugs at boots and gums up machinery. Then the storm moves on, the sun returns, and the surface hardens again, cracked and chalky, as if the place is trying to erase the evidence that water ever touched it. And at dusk, the same conditions that make living there punishing turn the sky into a blaze. Shorter wavelengths fall away and reds and oranges remain.  \"This is what it takes to deliver AI,\" Altman told CNBC on site in September. \"Unlike previous technological revolutions or previous versions of the internet, there's   that's required. And this is a small sample of it.\" A small sample: At roughly $50 billion per site, OpenAI's Stargate projects add up to about $850 billion in spending — nearly half of the $2 trillion global AI infrastructure surge HSBC now forecasts.  The Abilene campus already has one data center online, with a second nearly complete. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC the site could ultimately scale past a gigawatt of capacity — enough electricity to power about 750,000 homes, roughly the size of Seattle and San Francisco combined. \"The shovels that are going in the ground here today, they're really about compute that comes online in 2026,\" she said in September. \"That first Nvidia push will be for Vera Rubins, the new frontier accelerator chips. But then it's about what gets built for '27, '28, and '29. What we see today is a massive compute crunch.\" \"We are growing faster than any business I've ever heard of before,\" Altman said, squinting against the sun. \"And we would be way bigger now if we had way more capacity.\" Land is cheap. Governments are willing. And the grid, for now, can be persuaded to bend. Altman is not alone in building kingdoms. In the flatlands of  , where soybean fields once stretched to the horizon,  's Mark Zuckerberg is erecting a   monument to artificial intelligence. He calls it Hyperion, after the Greek titan. When finished, it will   — and cover a footprint the size of lower Manhattan. Across the Mississippi River,  , Arkansas,  's Google has broken ground on what state officials are calling the largest private capital investment in state history — a   rising from 1,100 acres of scrubland.  Thirty minutes south, on the Tennessee side of the border,   has already begun transforming the industrial wastelands of South Memphis. His supercomputer, Colossus, was built in   inside a shuttered Electrolux factory. Now he's constructing Colossus 2, aiming for   — and just   To power the site,   a shuttered Duke Energy power plant across the border in Southaven, Mississippi. In southeast Wisconsin,   is spending  on what CEO Satya Nadella calls   AI data center — a facility that will house hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips when it comes online in   And in rural Indiana, near Lake Michigan,   has transformed 1,200 acres of farmland into  , an $11 billion facility running entirely on custom silicon, built exclusively to train AI models for a startup called Anthropic. \"Cornfields to data centers, almost overnight,\" Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman told CNBC in Seattle in October. This is the AI boom rendered in steel and gravel — a slow carving of the country into zones of power and compute. What they're building is not infrastructure in any conventional sense. It is the physical manifestation of a belief — that intelligence itself can be manufactured at industrial scale, and that whoever builds the biggest factory wins. \"This is the largest market in the history of mankind,\" said Sameer Dholakia, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. \"This is larger than oil, because everyone on the planet needs intelligence.\" The sums involved have become difficult to comprehend. The top five hyperscalers — including Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta — are on track to spend approximately $443 billion on capital expenditures this year.   that figure will climb to $602 billion in 2026 — a 36% year-over-year increase. Their analysts estimate that approximately 75% of that spending will go directly into AI infrastructure. The current tech industry is among the most profitable in the history of the world, but not all of the companies necessarily have the cash on hand to cover the spend. The debt raise has been staggering. Hyperscalers have added   this year — more than four times the average annual issuance over the previous five years, according to  .   of that came in just the past three months. Meta tapped the bond market for  . Alphabet raised  . Oracle just pulled off an $18 billion  — and Citi says it now ranks as the largest issuer of investment-grade debt among non-financial U.S. companies. Wall Street expects the pace of borrowing to accelerate.  Analysts at   and   estimate AI's infrastructure push could drive up to   by tech companies in the coming years.   analysts forecast as much as $900 billion in new issuance coming in 2026 alone. \"There is something inherently uncomfortable as a credit investor about the transformation of the sort we're facing that is going to require an enormous amount of capital,\" Daniel Sorid, head of U.S. investment grade credit strategy at  , told investors on a video call earlier this month. You can see that discomfort in the derivatives market.  Credit-default swaps — insurance that pays out if a borrower can't service its debt — have widened to  . Barclays and Morgan Stanley have told clients to buy protection, and in late October, a liquid CDS market tied to Meta began actively trading for the first time as investors rushed to hedge what's becoming a hyperscaler debt boom.   There's precedent for debt-funded buildouts outrunning near-term demand. In the dot-com era, telecoms levered up to lay fiber fast. When conditions tightened, many had to restructure. The network survived — but the outcomes ranged from many early investors booking losses, to equity wipeouts. At the center of this infrastructure arms race sits OpenAI — and a web of interlocking deals that has reshaped the competitive landscape for AI. In the span of just two months this fall, the company announced partnerships totaling roughly $1.4 trillion in headline commitments — a figure that prompted skeptics to warn of an AI bubble and raised basic questions about whether the power, land, and supply chains exist to match the ambition. The deals came in rapid succession.  In September, OpenAI announced a   with Nvidia — the chip giant taking an ownership stake in OpenAI in exchange for 10 gigawatts of its next-generation systems.  , OpenAI teamed up with   to deploy its Instinct GPUs, with the agreement structured to potentially give OpenAI a 10% stake in the chipmaker. Days later,   to supply 10 gigawatts of custom chips co-designed with OpenAI. And  , OpenAI signed its first cloud contract with Amazon Web Services, further loosening Microsoft's once exclusive grip. \"We have to do this,\" OpenAI President Greg Brockman told CNBC   \"This is so core to our mission if we really want to be able to scale to reach all of humanity, this is what we have to do.\" Nvidia is effectively financing demand for its own chips, Oracle is building the sites, AMD and Broadcom are positioning as alternative suppliers, and OpenAI is anchoring the demand. Critics call it a circular economy: capital, capacity, and revenue all recycling through the same small set of players. It works as long as growth holds — but if demand slips or funding tightens, the stress can propagate fast through a web of shared exposures. Already,   there was \"no assurance\" it would enter a definitive agreement with OpenAI, or complete the investment on expected terms, a reminder that headline AI pacts often start as frameworks. Oracle's view from the jobsite is simpler: the demand is real, diversified, and already spoken for. \"We see broad-based demand across a huge swath of the industry, so it's not just from any one individual place,\" Clay Magouyrk, Oracle's newly elevated co-CEO, told CNBC in West Texas in September. \"I don't worry about a bubble, because I see committed demand for it.\" He described the appetite for compute as nearly limitless. \"When I look at myself, when I look at my teams at Oracle, when I look at our customers, I see what looks like near-infinite demand for technology — if we can enable them to use it.\" At the DealBook Summit in December, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei described the \"cone of uncertainty\" — a mismatch between long lead times and a market that can change in a quarter. Data centers take  , and chip orders are placed years in advance, even as demand forecasts keep shifting. \"You don't have $50 billion on you,\" he said, so the financing often gets wrapped into partnerships with chipmakers or cloud providers, where \"you can kind of pay as you go.\" Amodei insists Anthropic is trying to stay disciplined. \"I think there are some players who are not managing that risk well,\" he said, declining to share names. Critics question how much is firm, contracted demand versus aspirational headline math. Gil Luria, who covers technology cycles at D.A. Davidson, points to Oracle as a test case.  \"OpenAI made commitments that it's highly unlikely they'll be able to live up to,\" he said. \"Now they're backtracking and saying these aren't really commitments — these are frameworks. But talk to Oracle about that. Oracle thought they had a contract for $300 billion. They put that in their remaining performance obligations and made commitments to Wall Street based on that.\"  Oracle stock dropped 23% in November — its worst month since 2001. OpenAI's Friar rejected the \"circular economy\" framing during the interview with CNBC in West Texas. She compared it to the early days of the web. \"When the internet was getting started, people kept feeling like, 'Oh, we're overbuilding, there's too much.' And look where we are today, right? The internet is ubiquitous. AI is going to be like that.\" Friar said equity is too expensive, so OpenAI is preparing to take on debt for the first time to finance expansion. The company has reviewed more than   — weighing land, substations, and transmission capacity.  And like much of the industry, OpenAI is looking at every viable power source — renewables, gas, and even nuclear — as utilities and tech companies chase always-on power that wind and solar can't reliably provide themselves. \"The real bottleneck isn't money,\" she said. \"It's power.\" That demand isn't fading. In late December, SoftBank's Masayoshi Son agreed to pay  , a firm that invests in data centers. To fund the deal — and his $40 billion commitment to OpenAI — Son  . He later told a forum in Tokyo that he   over having to sell the shares. The scarce asset now is energized real estate — and the ability to plug in at scale. Power like that is regulated and permitted, which means the buildout also depends on Washington.  OpenAI has lobbied the Trump administration to   to cover AI data centers — though when its CFO floated the idea of a government \"backstop\" for infrastructure loans at a Wall Street Journal event in November, the backlash was swift enough that she walked it back within hours. Altman took to X to insist the company does not The companies aren't waiting for Washington. They're borrowing, building, and betting that the economics will catch up — because so far, every time they've scaled, the models have gotten better. That pattern is the industry's founding conviction: more compute produces more capable systems. It's why startups that have never turned a profit can still command valuations in the hundreds of billions. The wager isn't only that training ever-larger models will keep producing step-change intelligence. It's that the payoff is now spilling out of the lab, as those models are put to work across the economy — answering customers, writing code, routing claims, drafting contracts, compressing weeks of work into hours. That's inference: not training the model, but the everyday usage that turns models into products. Inference is where the hype has to convert into margins, and it's also where the compute bill never stops: each new user, workflow, or agent adds recurring demand, not a one-time training run. That's why the buildout has started to look less like a moonshot and more like a utility race, with companies scrambling to secure the power and capacity to serve what they expect will be always-on intelligence. \"We have continued to be surprised, even as the people who pioneered this belief in scaling laws,\" Daniela Amodei, Anthropic's president and co-founder, told CNBC during a sitdown at the company's headquarters in San Francisco. \"Every year we've been like, 'Well, this can't possibly be the case that things will continue on the exponential,' and then every year, it has.\" Anthropic's revenue has jumped tenfold, year-over-year, for the last three years. In 2025 alone, the startup's valuation surged from $60 billion to a funding round currently underway that could  . Dario Amodei, Daniela's brother, believes we are approaching something like   — AI systems that can perform at the level of Nobel laureates across every domain. He believes that threshold could come  . But he's also sounding alarms. \"Look at entry level consultants, lawyers, financial professionals, many of the white collar service industries, a lot of what they do, AI models are already quite good at without intervention,\" he told 60 Minutes. \"And my worry is that it'll be broad, and it'll be faster than what we've seen with previous technology.\" That belief is driving the industry's spending binge — but skeptics worry the buildout becomes a debt-fueled overreach, ending in a familiar cleanup: bankruptcies, fire sales, and shareholders wiped out. Matt Murphy, a venture capitalist at Menlo Ventures and an early Anthropic investor, frames it differently. \"I've been in the venture business for 25 years,\" Murphy said, \"I've seen the cloud wave, the mobile wave, the semiconductor wave. This is the mother of all waves.\" Stand back far enough and a new geography comes into focus.  Zuckerberg's Hyperion. Musk's Colossus. Altman's Stargate. Amazon's Rainier. Google's archipelago of compute clusters. Each one a monument to a different vision of the future — and each one anchored to the same constraint: power.  Data centers are rising near plants and transmission lines, in places with cheap land, willing governments, and grids that can be pushed to expand. And the towns around them are now showing up in investor decks, earnings calls, and trillion-dollar projections. Analysts tell CNBC the stakes are bigger than stock prices. Either this year marks the beginning of a transformation as profound as electrification and the internet, or it marks the peak of a bubble that future historians will study as a cautionary tale. Altman hears the doubts — but he rejects the notion that the buildout has gone too far. \"People will get burned on overinvesting,\" he told CNBC in September. \"And people also get burned on underinvesting and not having enough capacity.\"  \"Smart people will get overexcited, and people will lose a lot of money. People will make a lot of money. But I am confident that long term, the value of this technology is going to be gigantic to society,\" added Altman. For now, the construction continues. The trucks kick up dust. The transformers hum. And across the American heartland, the factories of a new age take shape.",

Following meetings with the company's executives across businesses, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterated a buy rating on MSFT stock with a  . The stock scores an \"outperform\" rating from TipRanks' AI Analyst with a price target of $562. \"Meeting with executives across Microsoft businesses leaves us with conviction on robust demand translating to durable mid-teens top-line growth and increased confidence in ROI contributing to continued operating margin expansion,\" said Weiss. Among the key takeaways from his meetings that he mentioned, Weiss highlighted that demand for Microsoft Azure has been stronger than what the company expected at the start of the year. The analyst added that demand is solid not only for Azure AI but across every product within the Azure portfolio, thanks to broader IT modernization efforts of enterprises. Consequently, Weiss raised his Azure estimates, assuming Azure AI gross margin (excluding OpenAI revenue share) reaches 30% by fiscal 2029. In fact, Weiss thinks that Azure AI margin can exceed 40%, suggesting huge upside to his estimates in the years ahead. Overall, Weiss called MSFT his Top Pick in the large-cap software sector, with the stock trading at 23x his calendar year 2027 GAAP EPS estimate of $20.65. The analyst contends that sustained top-line demand and the possibility for further margin expansion, as reflected in the company's Q1 FY26 results, are not yet fully valued by the market. Weiss ranks No. 400 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.1%.  Memory and storage solutions provider   ( ) impressed investors with market-beating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. The company also issued an upbeat outlook for the fiscal second quarter, reflecting strong demand for its high-performance memory and storage products amid the rapid growth in AI data centers. Impressed by the Q1 FY26 print, Stifel analyst Brian Chin reiterated a buy rating on Micron stock with a  . TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on MU stock, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $285. Discussing the \"blockbuster\" quarterly performance and outlook, Chin observed that Micron easily surpassed Stifel's above-consensus expectations with a higher average selling price (ASP) driving a 20% sequential growth in DRAM and NAND revenue. The 5-star analyst highlighted the robust demand, saying, \"Demand is outstripping supply, with Micron only able to meet 1/2 to 2/3 of some key customers' near term demand.\" Chin also noted the impressive rise in margins across all of Micron's business units, including the consumer-oriented Mobile and Client Business division, which saw its gross margin jump to 54% in Q1 FY26 from 36% in Q4 FY25. The analyst also discussed Micron's solid guidance and added that despite industry supply constraints, Micron expects both DRAM and NAND bit shipments to increase by 20% in 2026. Overall, Chin remains bullish on MU stock and noted that after another round of positive estimate revisions, the stock trades at less than 6x his next-12 months earnings per share estimate. Chin ranks No. 350 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 25.6%.",

        "full_text": "Lithium and steel outshined A.I. in 2025, at least when it comes to CNBC's exclusive Power City Indexes. The Power City Indexes (PCI) were built ten years ago. The 'indexes' are made up from the 11 or 12 largest market cap companies in 36 different city and metro areas around America.  The stocks are equally weighted in each index and tracked through the year on FactSet. The PCIs are an easy and exclusive way to find out which city or metro area is \"winning\" the stock market.   We highlight them through the year on CNBC and also bring them to you on CNBC Pro. They are meant more for fun, but we take them seriously.    Here's how we do it.  We base the city location on a company's headquarter location via a stock screener on S&P CapitalIQ.  Even if a company has more people in a different area, it is the location of the headquarters that matters for the PCI.  We use the median return for all 11 or 12 stocks.  And if a company is bought, the stock stays in the index until it delists, and then is replaced by the next largest company. Formalities now out of the way, let's have some fun and look at the median return for each region. The third best metro area for the stock market in 2025 was around our nation's capital.   Washington, D.C. listed companies — which includes those based in the city itself and those in the surrounding Virginia and Maryland suburbs — posted a solid year.  Defense contractors were an offensive play for investors, with  ,  ,   and  ) all popping.    It wasn't that long ago that all of these companies would've been represented in a different city's index, but over the past decade or so, they've all moved to be closer to the Pentagon and halls of power.   and   were some non-defense standouts for the D.C. PCI, which came in with about a 17% median return. Coming in second in our 2025 Power City Index ranking: Silicon Valley.   Given the hope and hype around A.I., perhaps the only real surprise here was that the metro area's market didn't win the whole thing.  Still, it was a nice year for investors up and down the US 101 corridor.   ,  ,  ,   and a company you may have heard about once or twice on CNBC this year –   – rocked it and powered the index to a 21%-plus median return.  If it wasn't for the more than 27% drop in shares of  , the Valley may have ruled the year. The biggest winner in 2025 goes to the Queen City of Charlotte, North Carolina.    The Charlotte PCI rose more than 22%, topping big tech by just over half a percent. Charlotte didn't have one stock that doubled, but it had seven big companies see their stocks rise more than 20%, pushing up the median return.  Big gains in lithium miner  , aerospace company  ,  ,   and   were the secret sauce to Charlotte's success this year and drove the area to victory in 2025 (a reference to the area's heavy NASCAR presence).    So a big congratulations and happy new year to Charlotte for having its Power City Index win the year in 2025.  We look forward to visiting soon.  Maybe even for the Panthers playoff game. And while we like to stay positive, it would be remiss to not note that the \"Big D\" stood for \"dud\" in 2025.   The worst performing Power City Index belonged to Dallas, Texas, with a median return of negative 10%.   Dallas has a lot of good things going for it, but the stock market wasn't one of them this year.    We look forward to following the country and its regional stock markets again next year.   Who knows, maybe we will even show up and do some CNBC TV from whichever region takes the crown.",

        "full_text": "In this article Valuations of several technology and artificial intelligence stocks are expected to remain in focus in 2026, as investors are concerned about the payoffs on massive AI spending. Nonetheless, top Wall Street analysts continue to be bullish on several tech and AI plays based on thorough analysis of their fundamentals, strong execution, and growth potential. Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is e-commerce and cloud computing giant   ( ). In a research note on the 2026 outlook for stocks in the AI and internet space, RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson called Amazon one of his favorite ideas, citing \"Best in-class visibility on AI infrastructure ROIC [return on invested capital] with compelling product cycle/capacity acceleration cycle coming.\" Erickson reaffirmed a buy rating on Amazon stock with a  . Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AMZN stock with an \"outperform\" rating but a lower price target of $240. The top-rated analyst said that he likes the structural positioning of the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit for two key reasons. First, Erickson highlighted that AWS has the most diversified and hedged revenue sources, with its core business largely unaffected by generative AI and not a competitor of ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Second, Erickson thinks that AWS is the most disciplined hyperscaler when it comes to capital spending. Notably, based on his ROIC scenario analysis, Erickson expects Amazon to see the fastest returns, with  -owned Google expanding more gradually, and   lagging in capital efficiency due to its indirect revenue model. He expects AWS to have the highest marginal contribution margin as the cloud unit increases its spending, thanks to its pay-as-you-go model and strong efficiency, with new capacity that is often pre-booked and revenue that is directly linked to infrastructure usage. Based on his optimistic outlook, Erickson raised his revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) estimates for 2026 and 2027, driven by higher AWS growth expectations and cost efficiencies. For 2028, the analyst expects revenue growth of 10% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%. Erickson ranks No. 195 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 21.9%.  Let's look at another tech giant,   ( ).

It clings to skin and the inside of your mouth, a fine grit that turns every breath into a reminder of where you are. This is the landscape where OpenAI CEO   is orchestrating something called Stargate — a  , backed by partners including  ,  , and  . Some 6,000 workers' vehicles pour into the site each morning. Tires raise a constant veil of silt over a construction footprint the size of a small city — more people working this single campus than OpenAI employs across its entire payroll. Rain comes in flashes. One minute the roads are powder; the next they're mud — thick, adhesive, the kind that tugs at boots and gums up machinery. Then the storm moves on, the sun returns, and the surface hardens again, cracked and chalky, as if the place is trying to erase the evidence that water ever touched it. And at dusk, the same conditions that make living there punishing turn the sky into a blaze. Shorter wavelengths fall away and reds and oranges remain.  \"This is what it takes to deliver AI,\" Altman told CNBC on site in September. \"Unlike previous technological revolutions or previous versions of the internet, there's   that's required. And this is a small sample of it.\" A small sample: At roughly $50 billion per site, OpenAI's Stargate projects add up to about $850 billion in spending — nearly half of the $2 trillion global AI infrastructure surge HSBC now forecasts.  The Abilene campus already has one data center online, with a second nearly complete. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC the site could ultimately scale past a gigawatt of capacity — enough electricity to power about 750,000 homes, roughly the size of Seattle and San Francisco combined. \"The shovels that are going in the ground here today, they're really about compute that comes online in 2026,\" she said in September. \"That first Nvidia push will be for Vera Rubins, the new frontier accelerator chips. But then it's about what gets built for '27, '28, and '29. What we see today is a massive compute crunch.\" \"We are growing faster than any business I've ever heard of before,\" Altman said, squinting against the sun. \"And we would be way bigger now if we had way more capacity.\" Land is cheap. Governments are willing. And the grid, for now, can be persuaded to bend. Altman is not alone in building kingdoms. In the flatlands of  , where soybean fields once stretched to the horizon,  's Mark Zuckerberg is erecting a   monument to artificial intelligence. He calls it Hyperion, after the Greek titan. When finished, it will   — and cover a footprint the size of lower Manhattan. Across the Mississippi River,  , Arkansas,  's Google has broken ground on what state officials are calling the largest private capital investment in state history — a   rising from 1,100 acres of scrubland.  Thirty minutes south, on the Tennessee side of the border,   has already begun transforming the industrial wastelands of South Memphis. His supercomputer, Colossus, was built in   inside a shuttered Electrolux factory. Now he's constructing Colossus 2, aiming for   — and just   To power the site,   a shuttered Duke Energy power plant across the border in Southaven, Mississippi. In southeast Wisconsin,   is spending  on what CEO Satya Nadella calls   AI data center — a facility that will house hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips when it comes online in   And in rural Indiana, near Lake Michigan,   has transformed 1,200 acres of farmland into  , an $11 billion facility running entirely on custom silicon, built exclusively to train AI models for a startup called Anthropic. \"Cornfields to data centers, almost overnight,\" Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman told CNBC in Seattle in October. This is the AI boom rendered in steel and gravel — a slow carving of the country into zones of power and compute. What they're building is not infrastructure in any conventional sense. It is the physical manifestation of a belief — that intelligence itself can be manufactured at industrial scale, and that whoever builds the biggest factory wins. \"This is the largest market in the history of mankind,\" said Sameer Dholakia, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. \"This is larger than oil, because everyone on the planet needs intelligence.\" The sums involved have become difficult to comprehend. The top five hyperscalers — including Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta — are on track to spend approximately $443 billion on capital expenditures this year.   that figure will climb to $602 billion in 2026 — a 36% year-over-year increase. Their analysts estimate that approximately 75% of that spending will go directly into AI infrastructure. The current tech industry is among the most profitable in the history of the world, but not all of the companies necessarily have the cash on hand to cover the spend. The debt raise has been staggering. Hyperscalers have added   this year — more than four times the average annual issuance over the previous five years, according to  .   of that came in just the past three months. Meta tapped the bond market for  . Alphabet raised  . Oracle just pulled off an $18 billion  — and Citi says it now ranks as the largest issuer of investment-grade debt among non-financial U.S. companies. Wall Street expects the pace of borrowing to accelerate.  Analysts at   and   estimate AI's infrastructure push could drive up to   by tech companies in the coming years.   analysts forecast as much as $900 billion in new issuance coming in 2026 alone. \"There is something inherently uncomfortable as a credit investor about the transformation of the sort we're facing that is going to require an enormous amount of capital,\" Daniel Sorid, head of U.S. investment grade credit strategy at  , told investors on a video call earlier this month. You can see that discomfort in the derivatives market.  Credit-default swaps — insurance that pays out if a borrower can't service its debt — have widened to  . Barclays and Morgan Stanley have told clients to buy protection, and in late October, a liquid CDS market tied to Meta began actively trading for the first time as investors rushed to hedge what's becoming a hyperscaler debt boom.   There's precedent for debt-funded buildouts outrunning near-term demand. In the dot-com era, telecoms levered up to lay fiber fast. When conditions tightened, many had to restructure. The network survived — but the outcomes ranged from many early investors booking losses, to equity wipeouts. At the center of this infrastructure arms race sits OpenAI — and a web of interlocking deals that has reshaped the competitive landscape for AI. In the span of just two months this fall, the company announced partnerships totaling roughly $1.4 trillion in headline commitments — a figure that prompted skeptics to warn of an AI bubble and raised basic questions about whether the power, land, and supply chains exist to match the ambition. The deals came in rapid succession.  In September, OpenAI announced a   with Nvidia — the chip giant taking an ownership stake in OpenAI in exchange for 10 gigawatts of its next-generation systems.  , OpenAI teamed up with   to deploy its Instinct GPUs, with the agreement structured to potentially give OpenAI a 10% stake in the chipmaker. Days later,   to supply 10 gigawatts of custom chips co-designed with OpenAI. And  , OpenAI signed its first cloud contract with Amazon Web Services, further loosening Microsoft's once exclusive grip. \"We have to do this,\" OpenAI President Greg Brockman told CNBC   \"This is so core to our mission if we really want to be able to scale to reach all of humanity, this is what we have to do.\" Nvidia is effectively financing demand for its own chips, Oracle is building the sites, AMD and Broadcom are positioning as alternative suppliers, and OpenAI is anchoring the demand. Critics call it a circular economy: capital, capacity, and revenue all recycling through the same small set of players. It works as long as growth holds — but if demand slips or funding tightens, the stress can propagate fast through a web of shared exposures. Already,   there was \"no assurance\" it would enter a definitive agreement with OpenAI, or complete the investment on expected terms, a reminder that headline AI pacts often start as frameworks. Oracle's view from the jobsite is simpler: the demand is real, diversified, and already spoken for. \"We see broad-based demand across a huge swath of the industry, so it's not just from any one individual place,\" Clay Magouyrk, Oracle's newly elevated co-CEO, told CNBC in West Texas in September. \"I don't worry about a bubble, because I see committed demand for it.\" He described the appetite for compute as nearly limitless. \"When I look at myself, when I look at my teams at Oracle, when I look at our customers, I see what looks like near-infinite demand for technology — if we can enable them to use it.\" At the DealBook Summit in December, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei described the \"cone of uncertainty\" — a mismatch between long lead times and a market that can change in a quarter. Data centers take  , and chip orders are placed years in advance, even as demand forecasts keep shifting. \"You don't have $50 billion on you,\" he said, so the financing often gets wrapped into partnerships with chipmakers or cloud providers, where \"you can kind of pay as you go.\" Amodei insists Anthropic is trying to stay disciplined. \"I think there are some players who are not managing that risk well,\" he said, declining to share names. Critics question how much is firm, contracted demand versus aspirational headline math. Gil Luria, who covers technology cycles at D.A. Davidson, points to Oracle as a test case.  \"OpenAI made commitments that it's highly unlikely they'll be able to live up to,\" he said. \"Now they're backtracking and saying these aren't really commitments — these are frameworks. But talk to Oracle about that. Oracle thought they had a contract for $300 billion. They put that in their remaining performance obligations and made commitments to Wall Street based on that.\"  Oracle stock dropped 23% in November — its worst month since 2001. OpenAI's Friar rejected the \"circular economy\" framing during the interview with CNBC in West Texas. She compared it to the early days of the web. \"When the internet was getting started, people kept feeling like, 'Oh, we're overbuilding, there's too much.' And look where we are today, right? The internet is ubiquitous. AI is going to be like that.\" Friar said equity is too expensive, so OpenAI is preparing to take on debt for the first time to finance expansion. The company has reviewed more than   — weighing land, substations, and transmission capacity.  And like much of the industry, OpenAI is looking at every viable power source — renewables, gas, and even nuclear — as utilities and tech companies chase always-on power that wind and solar can't reliably provide themselves. \"The real bottleneck isn't money,\" she said. \"It's power.\" That demand isn't fading. In late December, SoftBank's Masayoshi Son agreed to pay  , a firm that invests in data centers. To fund the deal — and his $40 billion commitment to OpenAI — Son  . He later told a forum in Tokyo that he   over having to sell the shares. The scarce asset now is energized real estate — and the ability to plug in at scale. Power like that is regulated and permitted, which means the buildout also depends on Washington.  OpenAI has lobbied the Trump administration to   to cover AI data centers — though when its CFO floated the idea of a government \"backstop\" for infrastructure loans at a Wall Street Journal event in November, the backlash was swift enough that she walked it back within hours. Altman took to X to insist the company does not The companies aren't waiting for Washington. They're borrowing, building, and betting that the economics will catch up — because so far, every time they've scaled, the models have gotten better. That pattern is the industry's founding conviction: more compute produces more capable systems. It's why startups that have never turned a profit can still command valuations in the hundreds of billions. The wager isn't only that training ever-larger models will keep producing step-change intelligence. It's that the payoff is now spilling out of the lab, as those models are put to work across the economy — answering customers, writing code, routing claims, drafting contracts, compressing weeks of work into hours. That's inference: not training the model, but the everyday usage that turns models into products. Inference is where the hype has to convert into margins, and it's also where the compute bill never stops: each new user, workflow, or agent adds recurring demand, not a one-time training run. That's why the buildout has started to look less like a moonshot and more like a utility race, with companies scrambling to secure the power and capacity to serve what they expect will be always-on intelligence. \"We have continued to be surprised, even as the people who pioneered this belief in scaling laws,\" Daniela Amodei, Anthropic's president and co-founder, told CNBC during a sitdown at the company's headquarters in San Francisco. \"Every year we've been like, 'Well, this can't possibly be the case that things will continue on the exponential,' and then every year, it has.\" Anthropic's revenue has jumped tenfold, year-over-year, for the last three years. In 2025 alone, the startup's valuation surged from $60 billion to a funding round currently underway that could  . Dario Amodei, Daniela's brother, believes we are approaching something like   — AI systems that can perform at the level of Nobel laureates across every domain. He believes that threshold could come  . But he's also sounding alarms. \"Look at entry level consultants, lawyers, financial professionals, many of the white collar service industries, a lot of what they do, AI models are already quite good at without intervention,\" he told 60 Minutes. \"And my worry is that it'll be broad, and it'll be faster than what we've seen with previous technology.\" That belief is driving the industry's spending binge — but skeptics worry the buildout becomes a debt-fueled overreach, ending in a familiar cleanup: bankruptcies, fire sales, and shareholders wiped out. Matt Murphy, a venture capitalist at Menlo Ventures and an early Anthropic investor, frames it differently. \"I've been in the venture business for 25 years,\" Murphy said, \"I've seen the cloud wave, the mobile wave, the semiconductor wave. This is the mother of all waves.\" Stand back far enough and a new geography comes into focus.  Zuckerberg's Hyperion. Musk's Colossus. Altman's Stargate. Amazon's Rainier. Google's archipelago of compute clusters. Each one a monument to a different vision of the future — and each one anchored to the same constraint: power.  Data centers are rising near plants and transmission lines, in places with cheap land, willing governments, and grids that can be pushed to expand. And the towns around them are now showing up in investor decks, earnings calls, and trillion-dollar projections. Analysts tell CNBC the stakes are bigger than stock prices. Either this year marks the beginning of a transformation as profound as electrification and the internet, or it marks the peak of a bubble that future historians will study as a cautionary tale. Altman hears the doubts — but he rejects the notion that the buildout has gone too far. \"People will get burned on overinvesting,\" he told CNBC in September. \"And people also get burned on underinvesting and not having enough capacity.\"  \"Smart people will get overexcited, and people will lose a lot of money. People will make a lot of money. But I am confident that long term, the value of this technology is going to be gigantic to society,\" added Altman. For now, the construction continues. The trucks kick up dust. The transformers hum. And across the American heartland, the factories of a new age take shape.",

Its share price rose 25% across 2025, following a 76% uptick over the previous year. \"Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2025 achieved strong growth both QoQ and YoY, exceeding our expectation of significant growth, causing a high base for the first quarter,\" the company said in a statement. Foxconn signed a partnership with OpenAI in November to collaborate on designs for next-generation AI infrastructure hardware. In May, it was announced that the company would partner with Nvidia and the Taiwanese government to provide infrastructure to a major AI factory in Taiwan.  also announced in July that it was taking a stake in data center construction company  . Foxconn said it expected earnings to be near the upper end of the past five-year range thanks to the continued rise in AI rack shipments, despite entering the \"traditional off-season\" for ICT products in the first quarter of the year.",

A fire in southwest Berlin on Saturday prompted a major power outage, with around 45,000 households and 2,200 commercial entities across four districts affected,   to grid operator Stromnetz Berlin.  The cause was   as a fire on a cable bridge over the Teltow Canal near the Lichterfelde power station, with several cables damaged as a result. Approximately 10,000 households and 300 businesses in Berlin's Lichterfelde district have since had electricity restored, Stromnetz Berlin said, although 35,000 households and 1,900 businesses remain affected.  The grid company said power for all customers is not expected to be restored until Thursday afternoon, at a time when Berlin is experiencing snowy conditions and sub-zero daily temperatures. Local officials have attributed the power outage to an arson attack from The Vulkangruppe (The Volcano Group), a left-wing extremist group. The Vulkangruppe   published a letter shortly after the attack, claiming responsibility for the incident. They said their actions were directed at the fossil fuel-based energy industry, citing the   and  . CNBC has been unable to independently verify the letter. \"The contemptuous attack on our power grid was not left-wing extremism. That was left-wing terrorism, and that must be clearly stated as such,\" Iris Spranger, Berlin's interior affairs minister, said at a press conference on Monday.  \"Here, collateral damage to the life and limb of people in #Berlin was deliberately accepted,\" Spranger said, according to a Google translation of her comments posted on X. The power outage comes around four months after a   on power lines in southeast Berlin affected around 50,000 households.

Since 2015, Nvidia has offered chips and other technology for cars under the brand name Drive, but that remains a small part of the company's business. Automotive and robotics chips accounted for just $592 million in sales in the quarter ended in October, or about 1% of Nvidia's total revenue. Nvidia announced a robotaxi partnership with  . The chipmaker said in December that it had developed software that can power a self-driving car and that Mercedes-Benz models to be released in late 2026 will be able to use Nvidia's technology to navigate cities like San Francisco. Self-driving cars remain one of the primary areas where Nvidia can show growth outside of AI infrastructure. CEO Jensen Huang has said that robotics — including self-driving cars — is the company's second most   after artificial intelligence. \"We imagine that someday, a billion cars on the road will all be autonomous,\" Huang said at a launch event on Monday at the CES conference in Las Vegas. \"You could either have it be a robotaxi that you're orchestrating and renting from somebody, or you could own it.\" In addition to chips that go inside self-driving cars, Nvidia sells access to its famed AI chips as well as its simulation software to automotive companies so they can train self-driving models and develop technology.  Nvidia says that car makers can use its   automotive computer, which costs about $3,500 per chip, to save on research and development costs and get self-driving features to market faster. Nvidia said it works with car makers to tune its technology, such as determining how hard the car should accelerate, for specific vehicles.  \"Some say, 'Hey, I need your help on training and optimizing my software on your chip, but I'll take care of simulation myself,'\" said Ali Kani, general manager of Nvidia's automotive platform. Car companies, like Mercedes-Benz, want to tune Nvidia's technology, market it as part of its in-car experience and sell it as part of or alongside a new car.   have caught on in the past year, led by   Waymo, which is operating a commercial taxi service without drivers in five U.S. markets, including San Francisco.  Nvidia's robotaxi announcement signals that it is targeting self-driving fleets in addition to personal cars that consumers can buy. In December, Nvidia offered reporters and analysts an hourlong ride through San Francisco in a 2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA sedan.  While my car had a safety driver employed by Mercedes-Benz behind the wheel, the driver said that the car was driving itself for 90% of the ride.  The drive was uneventful. San Francisco is a tricky city to drive in, with big hills, frequent red lights and trucks unloading in the middle of streets, but I never felt stressed and could focus on holding a conversation.  But there was one major snag: The driver took control during a thorny situation where two buses and a self-driving Waymo were trying to pass in a four-lane road with street parking that also had trucks on both sides unloading goods. The driver had to back the car up and wait for the jam to clear.  Nvidia said my drive was \"Level 2 Plus Plus,\" which means that its technology has features similar to   Full Self-Driving mode. Nvidia-powered cars like the Mercedes-Benz will have increasing self-driving capabilities, but the responsibility of keeping everyone safe still falls to the driver, who must pay attention at all times.  The chipmaker said the system would eventually be able to do \"park-to-park,\" meaning it can drive from a starting parking space to another, but the Mercedes-Benz CLA cars won't come with that feature to start.  \"Any parking situation that you feel is intimidating, that car will solve for you,\" said Mercedes-Benz Group CEO Ola Källenius at an Nvidia event on Monday.  The Mercedes-Benz model that Nvidia demonstrated was launched last year in Europe, but it's launching in the U.S. this year, Kani said.  The Mercedes-Benz cars were rolled out with lane keep and driver assistance features to help drivers stay in their lanes, Kani said. The vehicles received a lane-switching feature through a software update and will get hands-free highway driving, urban driving and park-to-park features this year. Nvidia said that it is using two AI systems in Drive-powered cars to ensure safety. The car mostly drives with an \"end-to-end\" system, called a vision-language model, that uses AI to decipher visual sensors and chart a path.  The chipmaker said it also built a second, safety-oriented \"stack\" that uses strict rules — such as stopping at a stop sign — to take over when the AI is unsure about what to do.  Still, Nvidia hopes that recent advances in generative AI — driven by the company's graphics processing units — will allow self-driving algorithms to become more capable. Nvidia is targeting 2028 for point-to-point self-driving features in consumer cars. Eventually, Nvidia said it wants to make the car itself feel like an actual driver that the users can simply speak to.  \"With transformers and generative AI, we can do much more,\" Wu said.",

        "full_text": "The Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth. Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

        "full_text": "In this article  on Monday unveiled plans to test a robotaxi service with a partner as soon as 2027, highlighting the chipmaker's ambition to become a major player in the world of self-driving cars.  The service would be offered with a partner, and would employ cars with \"Level 4\" driving, meaning they will be capable of driving without human intervention in pre-defined regions, Nvidia officials said at a self-driving demonstration in San Francisco last month. The company declined to name where it would operate and who its partner will be.  \"We will probably start with a limited availability but work with the partner for us to get our footing,\" Xinzhou Wu, Nvidia's vice president of automotive, said at the event.  Since 2015, Nvidia has offered chips and other technology for cars under the brand name Drive, but that remains a small part of the company's business. Automotive and robotics chips accounted for just $592 million in sales in the quarter ended in October, or about 1% of Nvidia's total revenue. Nvidia announced a robotaxi partnership with  . The chipmaker said in December that it had developed software that can power a self-driving car and that Mercedes-Benz models to be released in late 2026 will be able to use Nvidia's technology to navigate cities like San Francisco. Self-driving cars remain one of the primary areas where Nvidia can show growth outside of AI infrastructure. CEO Jensen Huang has said that robotics — including self-driving cars — is the company's second most   after artificial intelligence. \"We imagine that someday, a billion cars on the road will all be autonomous,\" Huang said at a launch event on Monday at the CES conference in Las Vegas. \"You could either have it be a robotaxi that you're orchestrating and renting from somebody, or you could own it.\" In addition to chips that go inside self-driving cars, Nvidia sells access to its famed AI chips as well as its simulation software to automotive companies so they can train self-driving models and develop technology.  Nvidia says that car makers can use its   automotive computer, which costs about $3,500 per chip, to save on research and development costs and get self-driving features to market faster. Nvidia said it works with car makers to tune its technology, such as determining how hard the car should accelerate, for specific vehicles.  \"Some say, 'Hey, I need your help on training and optimizing my software on your chip, but I'll take care of simulation myself,'\" said Ali Kani, general manager of Nvidia's automotive platform. Car companies, like Mercedes-Benz, want to tune Nvidia's technology, market it as part of its in-car experience and sell it as part of or alongside a new car.   have caught on in the past year, led by   Waymo, which is operating a commercial taxi service without drivers in five U.S. markets, including San Francisco.  Nvidia's robotaxi announcement signals that it is targeting self-driving fleets in addition to personal cars that consumers can buy. In December, Nvidia offered reporters and analysts an hourlong ride through San Francisco in a 2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA sedan.  While my car had a safety driver employed by Mercedes-Benz behind the wheel, the driver said that the car was driving itself for 90% of the ride.  The drive was uneventful. San Francisco is a tricky city to drive in, with big hills, frequent red lights and trucks unloading in the middle of streets, but I never felt stressed and could focus on holding a conversation.  But there was one major snag: The driver took control during a thorny situation where two buses and a self-driving Waymo were trying to pass in a four-lane road with street parking that also had trucks on both sides unloading goods. The driver had to back the car up and wait for the jam to clear.  Nvidia said my drive was \"Level 2 Plus Plus,\" which means that its technology has features similar to   Full Self-Driving mode. Nvidia-powered cars like the Mercedes-Benz will have increasing self-driving capabilities, but the responsibility of keeping everyone safe still falls to the driver, who must pay attention at all times.  The chipmaker said the system would eventually be able to do \"park-to-park,\" meaning it can drive from a starting parking space to another, but the Mercedes-Benz CLA cars won't come with that feature to start.  \"Any parking situation that you feel is intimidating, that car will solve for you,\" said Mercedes-Benz Group CEO Ola Källenius at an Nvidia event on Monday.  The Mercedes-Benz model that Nvidia demonstrated was launched last year in Europe, but it's launching in the U.S. this year, Kani said.  The Mercedes-Benz cars were rolled out with lane keep and driver assistance features to help drivers stay in their lanes, Kani said. The vehicles received a lane-switching feature through a software update and will get hands-free highway driving, urban driving and park-to-park features this year. Nvidia said that it is using two AI systems in Drive-powered cars to ensure safety. The car mostly drives with an \"end-to-end\" system, called a vision-language model, that uses AI to decipher visual sensors and chart a path.  The chipmaker said it also built a second, safety-oriented \"stack\" that uses strict rules — such as stopping at a stop sign — to take over when the AI is unsure about what to do.  Still, Nvidia hopes that recent advances in generative AI — driven by the company's graphics processing units — will allow self-driving algorithms to become more capable. Nvidia is targeting 2028 for point-to-point self-driving features in consumer cars. Eventually, Nvidia said it wants to make the car itself feel like an actual driver that the users can simply speak to.  \"With transformers and generative AI, we can do much more,\" Wu said.",

        "full_text": "The Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth. Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

        "full_text": "Nearly a year ago, DeepSeek shook the AI world.  Stocks of some of the leading Western tech companies plunged as the markets   at the prospect of a new model from a relatively unheard of Chinese AI lab that challenged the premise of U.S. dominance in the space.  plummeted 17%,   from its market cap. U.S. chipmaker   also fell 17%, and   dropped 7% in a single day. Eleven months on, and those companies have not just recovered but continued to grow. Nvidia became the first company to hit a   in October, Broadcom's shares rose 49% across 2025, with ASML's stock increasing 36%. \"January [DeepSeek] (R1) caused a broad, visible repricing because it changed global beliefs about frontier-model cost curves and China's competitiveness, and it did so in a way that hit the semiconductor and hyperscaler narrative directly,\" Haritha Khandabattu, senior director analyst at Gartner told CNBC.  Since then, DeepSeek has released seven new model updates. None have caused the kind of waves seen in January. So why haven't the markets reacted? Founded in 2023, DeepSeek released a free, open-source large language model (LLM) in late 2024, called V3, which it said was trained with less powerful chips and at a fraction of the cost of models built by the likes of OpenAI and Google.  Weeks later, in January 2025 it released a reasoning model, R1, that hit similar benchmarks or outperformed many of the world's leading LLMs.  The Chinese AI lab's January release \"really surprised the market,\" Alex Platt, senior analyst at investment firm D.A. Davidson, told CNBC. \"The narrative [at the time] was that China was 9 to 12 months behind the U.S.\" The promise of a model achieving similar results to the most advanced systems, but using less compute, raised concerns in the market that the demand for AI infrastructure would be impacted, and revenue for firms like Nvidia would be hit, Brian Colello, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC.  \"Instead, we saw no slowdown in spending in 2025, and as we look ahead, we foresee an acceleration of spending in 2026 and beyond.\" There's also the type of releases DeepSeek has made since January, all of which have been updates to the V3 and R1 models as opposed to entirely new models.  While DeepSeek's more  are \"credible step changes\" in efficiency and capability, the market has viewed them as a \"continuation and consolidation rather than a new shockwave,\" Khandabattu said. Part of the reason DeepSeek hasn't released a new model is likely due to limited compute, analysts told CNBC. \"Compute has been a large bottleneck,\" said Platt. \"You can only do so much algorithmic research and find so many architectural ingenuities.\" The AI company delayed the release of its R2 model, which was initially planned for May, because of challenges training it on homegrown Huawei chips, the Financial Times   in August.  Chinese authorities had encouraged DeepSeek to use the processors as it looked to reduce reliance on U.S. alternatives in the face of export controls on Nvidia's most powerful chips, the publication said. DeepSeek has been approached for comment on the report. \"China's been constrained in the amount of computing power it's been able to access over the last couple of years, in large part because of U.S. restrictions on the sale of chips,\" Chris Miller, author of \"Chip War,\" told CNBC. \"If you want to build advanced models, you need access to advanced compute.\" DeepSeek said in a research paper it released earlier this month that it acknowledges \"certain limitations when compared to frontier closed-source models\" such as Gemini 3, including compute resources.  Markets have also been reassured of continued U.S. leadership in the AI space by new advanced model releases from frontier labs in the West.  In August, OpenAI unveiled GPT-5, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5, and Google launched Gemini 3 in November.  \"The competition between these providers is intense with rapid model releases and incremental improvement in capabilities,\" Gartner Analyst Arun Chandrasekaran told CNBC. \"As a result, fears of a sudden commoditization shock have eased.\" But there are signs DeepSeek is gearing up for a more significant model release in the coming months. On New Year's eve the company published a paper detailing a more efficient way of developing AI models. Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives thinks there are more shocks in the market to come. \"Some of these moments that we've seen, we'll continue to see next year,\" he told CNBC. \"There'll be another DeepSeek.\"",
