        "full_text": "Are Rivian's deliveries a red flag? Or is there more to the story? Rivian Automotive ( RIVN 1.52% ) reported that it delivered 9,745 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2025, down 31% year over year from 14,183 deliveries in the year-ago quarter. The decline was even worse than Tesla's 16% year-over-year decline for the same period. But the rough quarter was \"in line with Rivian's expectations,\" management said in its Jan. 2 press release about the deliveries. So, what gives? Why were the electric vehicle company's fourth-quarter deliveries so weak, and should investors be worried? Image source: Rivian. Some context is in order. Rivian's fourth quarter should be viewed alongside the company's third-quarter results, when deliveries jumped 32% year over year. The reason the two quarters should be viewed together is because the federal clean-vehicle credit was no longer available for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025, effectively putting a deadline at the end of the third quarter and urging some customers to rush their orders. This undoubtedly pulled some demand from Q4 into Q3. This context helps explain why both electric vehicle companies, Tesla and Rivian, had great third quarters followed by bad fourth quarters. Notably, Rivian's production actually increased sequentially. Rivian produced 10,720 vehicles in Q3 and 10,974 vehicles in Q4. The higher Q4 production likely reflected an effort to normalize inventory after delivering 23% more vehicles than it produced in Q3. For Rivian investors, the main focus right now is the company's upcoming vehicle launch. Investors are likely hoping a new vehicle model can help catalyze sales and reverse Rivian's trend of declining sales in 2025 (full-year 2025 sales fell 18% year over year). Rivian's upcoming R2 is still on track to begin deliveries in the first half of 2026, the company said in its third-quarter shareholder letter. This will open up Rivian to a larger addressable market, as the vehicle is supposed to be price meaningfully below its current lineup. The new vehicle, which will be a midsized, 5-passenger SUV, will have a starting price of $45,000, management said in the company's third-quarter earnings call. \"The average price of new vehicles sold in the United States is around $50,000,\" said Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe during the call. \"So we're really bullish, really confident on R2 and what that represents for us as a business.\" Given the near-term noise of the now-expired federal clean-vehicle credit and its impact on quarterly deliveries, it would probably be wise for investors to zoom out and instead focus on Rivian's R2 plans. Making the stock somewhat risky, Rivian continues to burn through cash because it has not yet achieved profitability. Despite reporting strong growth in deliveries in Q3, Rivian still reported an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss of $602 million for the period. Even more, management's full-year 2025 guidance called for an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.00 billion to $2.25 billion. So, while it's encouraging to see the company building toward a potentially meaningful product cycle with R2, it's doing it while burning through a lot of money. Rivian ended Q3 with $7.09 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, which gives it runway. But with free cash flow , which measures the company's cash from regular operations less capital expenditures , being negative $1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2025, the company will continue burning through this cash until its business becomes cash flow positive. When investors look at Rivian through the lens of its upcoming R2 launch and its unprofitable business model next to its valuation, I personally think shares remain overvalued today. The company's market capitalization currently stands at about $24 billion. With the new R2 being priced lower than its current lineup, it may initially put pressure on the company's profit margins, further weighing on profitability. Longer term, of course, the hope is that R2 demand and production are high enough to help the company achieve economies of scale, enhancing its overall profitability. To date, however, Rivian hasn't proven it's capable of profitability. And given the magnitude of its adjusted EBITDA losses, I don't think profitability will occur soon. Overall, I think shares are overvalued -- even if we ignore the noise of disappointing fourth-quarter deliveries and look forward to the launch of the R2.

        "full_text": "Visa, ExxonMobil, Oracle, and Netflix have multi-year compounding potential for patient investors. Nvidia ( NVDA +1.14% ) ended 2025 as the most valuable company in the world. It is one of nine S&P 500 ( ^GSPC +0.19% ) stocks with market capitalizations exceeding $1 trillion -- the others being Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon , Meta Platforms , Broadcom , Tesla , and Berkshire Hathaway . Eli Lilly , Walmart , and JPMorgan Chase only need to rise 14% or less to expand the list to 12 companies. Here's why Visa ( V 1.21% ) , ExxonMobil ( XOM +1.80% ) , Oracle ( ORCL +0.41% ) , and Netflix ( NFLX 2.95% ) have what it takes to be winning investments over the next five years and join the $1 trillion club by 2030. Image source: Getty Images. Visa's path to $1 trillion is fairly straightforward. The payment processor has high margins, a reasonable valuation , and steady earnings growth, and returns tons of capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends . V Market Cap data by YCharts. Visa can generate high single-digit or double-digit earnings growth even during challenging periods. Despite slowdowns in consumer spending, Visa grew non-generally accepted accounting principles ( non-GAAP ) earnings per share by 14% in 2025. If Visa can maintain that growth rate going forward, it could reach a market cap well beyond $1 trillion by 2030. ExxonMobil will need to double in five years to surpass $1 trillion in market cap. It absolutely has what it takes. ExxonMobil is generating gobs of free cash flow (FCF) and high earnings, even though oil prices are hovering around four-year lows. It has reduced its production costs and can break even at low oil prices, and has plenty of upside potential during a higher-price environment. It also has a growing low-carbon business and a massive refining and marketing segment. ExxonMobil's corporate plan through 2030 forecasts double-digit earnings growth even if oil and gas prices are mediocre. Although the U.S. Energy Information Administration is only forecasting $55 per Brent crude oil barrel in 2026, oil prices could rise in the coming years due to economic demand fueled by artificial intelligence (AI) , as well as overall economic growth and geopolitical tensions. Either way, ExxonMobil doesn't need a lot of help from oil prices to grow earnings at a solid pace. A 15% annual growth rate, compounded over five years, would double earnings. Given the stock's reasonable volatility, it could double as well, pole-vaulting ExxonMobil over the $1 trillion bar. In the meantime, ExxonMobil investors will benefit from its stable and growing 3.4% dividend, which ExxonMobil has increased for 43 consecutive years. Oracle almost surpassed $1 trillion in market cap in September before falling over 40% from that high due to concerns about its AI spending and mounting debt. Oracle is ramping up spending to build out data center infrastructure to grow its cloud computing market share , especially for high-performance computing workflows. It exited its most recent quarter with $523 billion in remaining performance obligations, signaling demand is high for its infrastructure. But Oracle needs to convert capital expenditures into earnings. In the meantime, it is FCF negative, making Oracle a leveraged bet on increased AI adoption . Despite its risks, Oracle's potential is impossible to ignore . Oracle is a great buy for investors who agree that its aggressive AI investments are the right long-term move and are willing to endure what will likely be a highly volatile period in the stock price. Over the last six months, Netflix's market cap has slipped from over $560 billion to under $400 billion due to a mix of valuation concerns and uncertainties regarding its planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery ( WBD 1.08% ) . Netflix will probably receive regulatory approval for the acquisition , but still faces challenges from Paramount Skydance ( PSKY 1.64% ) , which is attempting a hostile takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery. But with or without Warner Bros. Discovery , Netflix has what it takes to steadily grow earnings through a combination of global subscriber growth and pricing power. If Netflix were to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, it could create a highly lucrative top-tier streaming platform that features content from both Netflix and HBO, as well as a revamped ad-supported tier. Even without HBO, Netflix has mastered the art of aligning content spending with steady subscription revenues, thanks to its depth and breadth of content -- from building global franchises from scratch like Stranger Things , to the success of KPop Demon Hunters . Netflix has already demonstrated impeccable pricing power with multiple price increases in a relatively short amount of time and a crackdown on password sharing that was largely accepted by users -- even during a period when people are pulling back on discretionary spending . So even if it doesn't quite crack the $1 trillion club, I still fully expect Netflix to be a winning investment and outperform the S&P 500 over the next five years. With the broader indexes around all-time highs, it's easy to get enamored by the companies that could surge in value in the coming months or in 2026. But a far more rewarding approach is to invest in companies that have what it takes to compound in value over the long term. Visa, ExxonMobil, Oracle, and Netflix certainly fit that mold. That's why I expect all four stocks to outperform the S&P 500 and join the $1 trillion club over the next five years, even though they are currently far from reaching that milestone.
