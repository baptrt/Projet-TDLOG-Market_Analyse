The technology sector has been on a roll over the past few years, especially as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has brought many investors into tech companies, hoping to take advantage of the new growth opportunities the technology promises. With many tech stocks flourishing, tech exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have naturally followed suit. One in particular, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF ( VGT +0.43% ) is up nearly 21% year to date through November, outpacing the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite . Despite VGT's success through the first 11 months of the year, it's an ETF I would steer clear of this month. Let's take a look at why. Image source: Getty Images. VGT tracks the U.S. information technology sector, containing 314 companies across a range of industries in the sector. The top five industries are semiconductors , systems software, technology hardware, application software, and semiconductor materials and equipment. A key aspect of VGT is that it's weighted by market cap, meaning larger companies account for a greater share of the ETF than smaller ones. And that brings me to why I'm avoiding VGT in December. The explosion of megacap tech stocks has led a few stocks to account for too much of VGT for my liking. Below are VGT's top three holdings and how much they account for of the ETF: Data source: Vanguard and Google Finance. Market cap as of 11 a.m. ET on Dec. 1. There's no doubt that all three of the above companies are world-class. Nvidia has a strong hold on GPUs and other hardware essential to the AI ecosystem, Apple has revolutionized tech hardware as we know it, and Microsoft is the tech Swiss Army knife, with its hands in virtually every tech industry. That said, having three companies account for over 45% of a 314-stock ETF isn't ideal. There are several tech-focused ETFs you can invest in that hold a good amount of Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft, without being so dependent on their performance. Take the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF , which mirrors the Nasdaq-100 , for example. The above three stocks make up about a quarter of the ETF, yet QQQ's performance almost mirrors VGT's so far this year. VGT data by YCharts High concentration works out in the investor's favor when those companies are flourishing (which they have been), but all it takes is a slump from them to weigh the whole ETF down. With increased uncertainty surrounding the market to begin December, I would prefer not to be so reliant on a few companies. Stefon Walters has positions in Apple and Microsoft.

{"company": "TSLA", "title": "Great News for Tesla Investors", "publisher": "Motley Fool", "link": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/12/06/great-news-for-tesla-investors/", "summary": "Elon Musk is aiming to take the company's full self-driving technology into new markets in 2026.", "time": "2025-12-07 02:25:00", "full_text": "Elon Musk is aiming to take the company's full self-driving technology into new markets in 2026. Tesla ( TSLA +0.09% ) recently declared, via an X post, that it was \"excited to bring its full self-driving (FSD) to our owners in Europe soon\" after claiming that the relevant agency in the Netherlands -- the Netherlands Vehicle Authority (RDW) -- \"has committed to granting Netherlands National approval in February 2026.\" It's not quite as straightforward as implied in Tesla's post, but it still represents a significant development in unlocking the full value of the electric vehicle (EV) maker's technology, potentially serving as a major stepping stone toward management's long-term goals. If Tesla's value lies primarily in its robotaxi and FSD businesses, then it makes sense to view positive developments on both issues as having a disproportionate impact on the stock. To clarify, they are distinct but closely-related concepts. The company currently has supervised FSD (which requires a driver to be ready to assume control) available in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico, New Zealand, Australia, Mexico, and China. Its supervised FSD is not quite the same as the more advanced supervised FSD version the company is using for its robotaxi rollout , and neither version is the unsupervised FSD that Tesla is aiming for. As such, the approval of supervised FSD doesn't mean robotaxis are approved. However, it would represent a major stepping stone on the road to European approval for commercial deployment of Tesla robotaxis, as they have been in Austin, Texas. Not least, as customers gain experience with FSD, the company will begin to collect a vast amount of data from a fleet of its vehicles driving with FSD. The lack of commercially available supervised FSD is hindering Tesla's growth potential, and in turn, any snowball effect of interest in its robotaxi concept. For example, on the last earnings call, chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said that the company's \"total paid FSD customer base is still small, around 12% of our current fleet. We're moving -- we're working with regulators in places like China and [the Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region] to obtain approvals so that we can get FSD in those regions as well.\" Image source: Tesla. Consequently, FSD approval in the Netherlands, followed by wider-scale approvals in Europe, would open up more potential customers across the European Union (EU). As the RDW outlined in a public response to Tesla's message on X, if and when it grants Tesla approval, the Netherlands can \"submit an application to the European Commission on behalf of the manufacturer,\" according to RDW. An EU-wide decision is then made by a qualified majority vote (at least 55% of EU states representing at least 65% of the EU population). A \"yes\" vote leads to EU-wide approval, while a \"no\" vote would leave FSD approved in the Netherlands with further decisions then made at a coutry level in Europe. Clearly, there are several pathways for Tesla to receive multiple approvals for FSD in Europe in 2026, if not a single EU-wide green light. FSD approval is crucial for Tesla because the stock's valuation is not based on its EV business. It will also raise awareness for the potential for robotaxis and add value to the company's EVs and its robotaxi concept. Tesla is already going all-in on Cybercab production in 2026, partly on CEO Elon Musk's conviction and \"clarity\" that unsupervised FSD is around the corner. Image source: Tesla. While there's no guarantee that the RDW will grant Tesla's supervised FSD approval next year, it's clearly a milestone event that would strengthen the case for the stock. That said, the commitment to ramping up EV and Cybercab production in 2026 is increasing the downside risk if the ongoing robotaxi rollout falters or there's a slowdown in FSD approvals worldwide. As such, Tesla remains an attractive stock for growth investors and has considerable upside potential, but it's not suitable for those without a tolerance for downside risk.

{"company": "AAPL", "title": "1 Unstoppable Stock to Buy Before It Joins Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet in the $3 Trillion Club", "publisher": "Motley Fool", "link": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/12/06/1-unstoppable-stock-to-buy-before-it-joins-nvidia/", "summary": "Amazon isn't far from joining the $3 trillion club.", "time": "2025-12-07 00:50:00", "full_text": "Amazon isn't far from joining the $3 trillion club. The $3 trillion valuation club is an exclusive group that only a handful of companies have ever joined. Currently, all four companies that have crossed this threshold are still in the club, with Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , and Microsoft all valued at $3 trillion or greater. And there's another company knocking on the door: Amazon ( AMZN +0.16% ) . Amazon currently has a market cap of $2.5 trillion, so it's only a stone's throw away from entering the $3 trillion club. However, I think that's just the beginning for the company since it has a lot going for it right now. The first thing that comes to mind when you hear the name \"Amazon\" is its e-commerce platform, which sells nearly every product available. That's its most forward-facing segment to the consumer and what allowed it to grow from an upstart to the $2.5 trillion behemoth it is today, but it's not what I'm most excited about as an investor. Two of Amazon's most important segments are ones that few people interact with on a daily basis. Its most important segments are the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business and its advertising division. Both of these are the company's fastest-growing segments, which align with importance and performance. AWS is capitalizing on two major tailwinds in cloud computing: artificial intelligence and a general migration to the cloud. Companies are starting to move away from on-premise computing equipment because it shifts the system maintenance to a third party and requires fewer equipment purchases. AI is obviously huge in the broader market right now, and cloud computing providers play a significant role in delivering AI computing power to non-AI hyperscalers. Few companies have the resources to build large data centers to drive their AI aspirations, so they turn to a cloud provider like AWS to fulfill those needs. This is a tailwind that won't decrease anytime soon, and it's starting to show up in AWS' results. During the third quarter, AWS grew revenue 20% year over year, the best in multiple quarters. The cloud provider is a crucial part of Amazon's profitability, too, as it accounted for 66% of total operating income during the third quarter. With a strong 35% operating margin, AWS' continued success will be a key part of driving Amazon toward a $3 trillion market cap. Advertising isn't as large a component as AWS, but it's Amazon's fastest-growing segment, with revenue rising 24% year-over-year in the third quarter. Management doesn't break advertising out into its own business unit, but we know from other companies, such as Meta Platforms or Alphabet, that advertising profit margins are quite high. This likely places advertising services in AWS-like operating margin ranges, showcasing its importance to Amazon's overall profitability picture. The ad market is currently strong, and Amazon is expanding its dominance in this space. It will likely continue to have outsize growth compared to the rest of the business (besides AWS) and will lead the company to a $3 trillion market cap. But how soon will it get there? With Amazon needing about 20% growth to join the $3 trillion club, it may not take that long to get there. Its growth rate has been accelerating in recent quarters, and if it keeps its spending under control to boost profits, it could easily reach the $3 trillion threshold by the end of next year. AMZN Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth); data by YCharts. YoY = year over year. Amazon is a strong pick for 2026, and I think it could reach the $3 trillion club by next year . If it fails to do so by 2026, I think it's likely to achieve it by 2027, as long as nothing drastic happens to the company or the market.

{"company": "AAPL", "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the First Tech Company to Split Its Stock in 2026", "publisher": "Motley Fool", "link": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/12/07/prediction-this-will-be-the-first-tech-company-to/", "summary": "Several companies in big tech have split their stock in recent years.", "time": "2025-12-07 05:50:00", "full_text": "Several companies in big tech have split their stock in recent years. As the end of 2025 approaches, it's looking like another strong year for the stock market. As of this writing (Dec. 2), the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC +0.19% ) and Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC +0.31% ) have gained 16% and 21% on the year, respectively. In a similar fashion to the last couple of years, artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been some of the biggest gainers in the market. Shares of Nvidia and Alphabet have outperformed the major indexes, while Apple , Meta Platforms , and Microsoft ( MSFT +0.43% ) have posted double-digit gains. Throughout the AI revolution, a number of big tech companies have completed stock splits as their valuations soared into the stratosphere. Let's explore how stock splits work and why they are important. From there, I'll review some of the more notable splits in the AI era and reveal my prediction for why Microsoft could be the first big-name stock split of 2026. Image source: Getty Images. When a stock begins to experience outsized momentum , investors generally tend to view the rising share price as expensive. While such a notion could be true, the absolute dollar value of a stock price reveals little about the company's underlying valuation . Nevertheless, managers at large corporations understand investor psychology. So, if they notice that trading volume is trending down or that their stock is primarily being bought and held by institutional investors , companies may choose to split their stock. Right now, shares of Microsoft trade for $490 and the company has an outstanding share count of 7.4 billion shares. If the company were to complete a 5-for-1 split, for example, Microsoft's share price would become $98 and its outstanding shares would rise to roughly 37 billion. As investors can see, in a stock split a company's stock price and share count move by the same ratio. This is important to understand, as stock splits do not inherently change the market capitalization of a company. Broadly speaking, companies will engage in a stock split in an effort to broaden their investor base -- making shares more accessible to retail investors who had been sitting on the sidelines. In addition, stock splits often garner lots of chatter from talking heads on financial news programs. With that in mind, splits can also act as a subtle form of marketing for a company. Image source: Getty Images. Over the last five years, several members of the \" Magnificent Seven \" including Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla have opted to split their stock. More recently, Broadcom and Netflix have also joined big tech stock splits. NVDA data by YCharts As the trends in the chart above illustrate, these stocks had experienced sustained stock price appreciation prior to splitting their shares. Microsoft stock has gained 92% during the AI revolution. While that's an impressive return, the Windows maker has lagged the broader Nasdaq index. The last time Microsoft completed a stock split was in February 2003. Since then, shares of Microsoft have gained nearly 2,000%. MSFT data by YCharts What's interesting is that Microsoft stock was relatively flat for a decade. During the early and mid-2000s, innovation was low at Microsoft and the company was largely viewed as a dinosaur compared to the likes of Apple and other internet darlings. While the company's cloud unit, Azure, has become a formidable player in the AI landscape, it still lags in market share compared to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Moreover, even though Microsoft has explored designing its own custom chips, it's unlikely the company is going to dethrone Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices in the data center accelerator market anytime soon. The chip industry's latest threat appears to be coming from Alphabet -- not Microsoft. I think part of Microsoft's problem is that despite all of its progress on the AI front, the company is still perceived as an archaic brand by many. Given several of its cohorts have completed splits in recent years, combined with Microsoft's respectable but perhaps somewhat pedestrian performance relative to its peers in recent years, I think a stock split could be one mechanism the company uses to rejuvenate enthusiasm from investors. It's important to note that a potential Microsoft stock split is merely a fun prediction on my end. Whether the company actually chooses to split its stock next year is irrelevant. While the competitive landscape is intensifying, Microsoft has still proven to be a solid investment choice among megacap AI stocks over the last few years. I view Microsoft as a compelling opportunity to buy and hold for the long run, and see the company as a nice complement to existing positions in cloud hyperscalers and chip designers alike.

Apple ( AAPL 0.75% ) is the world's second-largest company after Nvidia ( NVDA 0.56% ) , with a market cap of about $4.2 trillion. That's a monster business, but I don't think it will stay in second place for long. I don't think it will become the world's largest company, either. I believe some other stocks will pass Apple during the next few years, based on its slow growth and high valuation. It's likely that Alphabet ( GOOG +1.08% ) ( GOOGL +1.09% ) , Microsoft ( MSFT +0.43% ) , and Amazon ( AMZN +0.16% ) will grow to become larger companies than Apple by market cap . Image source: Getty Images. As the third-largest company in the world, Alphabet doesn't have a long way to go to pass Apple as the second-largest company in the world. It's about $300 billion behind Apple right now, but if every company were valued the same, it would already be larger: AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts . Alphabet generates more net income than Apple does, so if it received the same valuation on its stock price, it would actually be worth more. Furthermore, Alphabet is growing far faster. Its revenue and operating income growth rates are nearly double those of Apple's, and its prospects are far brighter. It's openly challenging Nvidia 's dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) computing market, as it may sell its tensor processing units (TPUs) to Meta Platforms as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Its advertising platform Google is also doing quite well, and if that keeps up, Alphabet will have no issue passing Apple in market cap during the next three years. Microsoft is in a similar boat as Alphabet, just with less impressive net income figures: AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts . Microsoft's net income is only a sliver behind Apple's total. If you factor in Microsoft's growth rates, it will be no time before it passes Apple in market cap. (It's about $3.6 trillion now.) Microsoft has a thriving software business and a strong cloud computing platform that's growing on the back of powerful AI demand. These tailwinds aren't going to slow during the next few years, and they make Microsoft a strong candidate to pass Apple in market cap. Last in this group is Amazon. It has the toughest road by far. It's market value is about $1.7 trillion smaller than Apple's ($2.5 trillion at this writing) and is valued in roughly the same ballpark, at about 30 times forward earnings . It's revenue is growing only slightly faster, with its most recent quarter delivering 13% growth versus Apple's 8%. That isn't going to cut it to make up the $1.7 trillion difference in three years. However, Amazon has two tricks up its sleeve. The first is its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services. AWS experienced a growth resurgence during the third quarter, with revenue rising 20% year over year -- the fastest in many quarters.  With AWS accounting for 66% of operating income in Q3, it's a key part of Amazon's profitability picture. The second key to Amazon's rising profitability is its advertising business. This is its fastest-growing business unit, accounting for 24% growth in Q3. Although Amazon doesn't break out division\u00a0profitability as it does with AWS, we know from other advertising-focused businesses like Alphabet that its margins are likely quite healthy. A combination of Amazon's sustained growth and Apple's premium valuation decreasing due to low growth rates could push Amazon to become a larger company than Apple during the next three years. While this isn't a sure bet, I think it's probable. Keithen Drury has positions in Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia.

There's a lot to like about the business. The membership-based wholesale retailer's sales growth remains solid, and a recent membership fee increase should help bolster profits this year. With that said, even though the business continues to perform well, it may not be good enough to justify the stock's incredibly high valuation . Indeed, Costco commands a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio that towers over faster-growing big tech companies like Nvidia and Apple . Here are some of the main reasons I think shares have struggled this year. Image source: Getty Images. Costco recently closed out fiscal 2025 with another solid year of growth. The company's revenue rose about 8% for both the fourth quarter and the full year. This revenue growth was helped by comparable sales (adjusted to exclude the impact of changes in foreign exchange and gas prices) increasing 6.4% and 7.6% for Q4 and full year, respectively. While these are good numbers, there are two problems. First of all, the company's Q4 comparable store-sales growth rate is slower than the full-year growth rate, suggesting a slight slowdown. Making matters worse, Costco's November monthly sales growth was a notch softer than October. Specifically, Costco's adjusted comparable store sales rose 6.4% in November, down slightly from adjusted comparable store sales growth of 6.8% in October. A second piece of the puzzle is the timing of Costco 's most important profit driver: membership fees. After a long stretch without a fee increase, Costco raised annual dues in the U.S. and Canada late last year. It increased the base Gold Star fee by $5 and the Executive tier by $10. While that change contributed to a 14% jump in membership fees in fiscal 2025's Q4, this means that the company will be up against a tough comparison this time next year. Even more, Costco has historically boosted membership prices only about every five-and-a-half years -- and management has signaled that it treats these hikes cautiously, using them sparingly and reinvesting part of the extra income into the value of its products and richer perks instead of dropping every dollar to the bottom line. Therefore, with the latest increase just over a year old, another hike is unlikely for several more years. In other words, Costco is unlikely to benefit from another membership fee increase for years. All of this feeds into the main headwind: valuation. A slight deceleration in comparable sales growth or a lack of major catalysts in the coming years wouldn't normally be a thesis breaker for a company that consistently grows and boasts competitive advantages from both scale and a loyal customer base. But the stock's high valuation unfortunately demands high standards. Even after the recent pullback, Costco trades at about 49 times earnings. Considering that the S&P 500 has a P/E of 25, it's easy to see why investors should demand spectacular performance from Costco. Paying that kind of price can still work if growth reaccelerates or if margins expand meaningfully. But given the company's model, which centers around passing any savings it achieves from scale onto its customers, rapid margin expansion is unlikely. Furthermore, given how established its presence is in the U.S. and Canada, Costco would likely need a huge lift from international markets to see sales growth reaccelerate meaningfully. With all of this said, I love Costco. I love shopping there, and I love the business model. But I don't love the stock -- not at this price. Daniel Sparks and his clients have positions in Apple.

However, investors should remember that most of the S&P 500's rally was driven by high-growth tech giants like Nvidia , Apple , Microsoft , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta , and Tesla . Those \"Magnificent Seven\" companies still account for more than a third of the index's entire market cap and often overshadow its smaller and less popular stocks. But if we look beyond the Magnificent Seven stocks, we'll see plenty of undervalued stocks in the S&P 500 that are trading well below their all-time highs. Some of them also pay high dividends -- and they could attract more income investors as interest rates decline. One of those stocks is Altria ( MO 0.60% ) , the largest tobacco company in America. It's currently trading 14% below its all-time high, but I believe it's still a great dividend stock to buy and hold forever. Image source: Getty Images. Altria, which was once known as Philip Morris, dominates the domestic cigarette market with its flagship Marlboro cigarettes. In 2008, Altria spun off its overseas business as Philip Morris International . At the time, Altria planned to right-size its shrinking domestic business as PMI expanded across higher-growth overseas markets. Altria might initially seem like a wobbly investment as adult smoking rates in the U.S. sink to multi-decade lows. From 2019 to 2024, its annual shipments of smokeable products (cigarettes and cigars) dropped from 103.45 billion sticks to 70.34 billion sticks, its retail cigarette market share shrank from 49.7% to 45.9%, and Marlboro's share dipped from 43.1% to 41.7%. But during those five years, Altria's revenue (net of excise taxes) still grew at a CAGR of 0.7% as its adjusted EPS increased at a CAGR of 3.9%. The company achieved that stable growth by raising prices, cutting costs, and buying back more shares to boost its earnings per share (EPS). It also divested some of its non-core assets (including its winemaking division) and expanded its portfolio of smoke-free products -- which includes e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches. Altria still generated 87% of its revenue (net of excise taxes) from its smokeable products in 2024, but plans to reduce that percentage over the next few years. A major catalyst should be its acquisition of the leading e-cigarette maker Njoy for $2.8 billion in 2023. It expects that acquisition to become accretive to its EPS growth in 2026. Altria also plans to sell more On nicotine pouches (which are managed separately by its Helix Innovations subsidiary) and new heated tobacco products -- which electrically heat up tobacco sticks instead of burning them -- to curb the company's long-term dependence on traditional cigarettes. Altria expects to generate $5 billion in smoke-free revenue by 2028. That would be equivalent to nearly a quarter of its $20.4 billion in revenue (net of excise taxes) in 2024. As it expands that nascent business, it will continue to streamline its business with its \"Optimize and Accelerate\" initiative to achieve at least $600 million in annual cost savings over the next five years. It also initiated a new $1 billion buyback plan (equivalent to about 1% of its market cap) last year. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Altria's adjusted EPS to grow at a CAGR of 4% as those tailwinds kick in. At $59, it looks dirt cheap at 11 times next year's adjusted earnings . As for its dividend, the company raised its payout every year after it spun off PMI. It also spent just 75% of its free cash flow (FCF) on those dividends over the past 12 months, which gives it plenty of room for future dividend hikes. It currently pays an hefty forward dividend yield of 7.2% -- which is much higher than the 10-Year Treasury's 4.1% yield. Altria's low valuation and high dividend yield should limit its downside potential, and it should attract more defensive investors if the broader market cools. So even though this tobacco giant won't outperform the Magnificent Seven anytime soon, it's still a reliable S&P 500 dividend stock to buy and hold forever.

But that could change in 2026.", "time": "2025-12-06 10:25:00", "full_text": "The stock may be underperforming this year. But that could change in 2026. Apple ( AAPL 0.75% ) spent much of 2025 out of favor as investors worried about stalled growth and a late pivot into AI (artificial intelligence) . But after being down more than 20% for the year by mid-June, the stock has roared higher. Investors have cheered as the company's top-line growth rate accelerated and management guided for double-digit iPhone revenue growth during the holiday quarter. Is it too late to buy the stock? I don't think so. In fact, it's my second-biggest holding. A well-received iPhone cycle, a powerful services business, and emerging AI features build a strong bull case for the stock. Here's a closer look at the reasons I'm betting on Apple stock going into 2026. iPhone 17 Pro Max. Image source: Apple. Fiscal 2025 marked a clear turn in Apple's fundamentals. Revenue for the fiscal year rose about 6% year over year to about $416 billion, up from $391 billion in fiscal 2024. Not only was the second half of the year's growth greater than the first half, but this came after several years of poor top-line performance. Indeed, between the end of fiscal 2022 and the end of fiscal 2024, Apple's sales actually declined. Importantly, the growth in Apple's bottom line recently has been even better. Fiscal 2025 earnings per share (EPS) rose 23% year over year. Looking to fiscal 2026, Apple's top-line performance is likely to accelerate further. Apple's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (the period that aligns closely with the fourth quarter of 2025) points to management's confidence in both its latest iPhone 17 cycle and its services business. On the earnings call, executives said they expect total revenue for the period to grow roughly 10% to 12%. Management said this will be supported by double-digit growth in iPhone revenue and services revenue similar to the 13.5% growth the business saw in fiscal 2025. Then there's the possibility that Apple's investments in AI and the resulting features the company deploys across its product line, like Apple's planned overhaul of Siri next year, help catalyze even more device upgrades. In fact, I'd argue that Apple's biggest opportunity in 2026 arguably goes beyond the iPhone 17 cycle and rests on how Apple Intelligence and services deepen engagement across an enormous installed base of active devices. The company confirmed this summer that it has more than 2.35 billion active devices in use worldwide, and it has said since then that the number has continued to grow. All of this to say, AI could not only strengthen Apple's already strong services business by providing more ways to monetize the company's installed base and by offering features to improve engagement, but it could also accelerate device sales. Another key reason to bet on Apple stock as one of my top picks for 2026 is the company's disciplined approach to spending. The iPhone maker's capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 were just $12.7 billion. Many other big tech companies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure. Meta , for instance, expects capital expenditures in 2025 to total between $70 billion and $72 billion, and Alphabet expects to spend between $91 billion and $93 billion. Apple's choice to avoid such unprecedented levels of spending on cloud computing makes it a nice counter to the companies that are spending heavily on AI-related infrastructure. Of course, one risk is Apple stock's valuation. With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 34 as of this writing, investors clearly have big expectations for the iPhone maker. If growth doesn't materialize as much as investors hope, shares could take a hit. But I personally believe the company's tailwinds are both strong and diverse, making the stock worth its current valuation. More importantly, I think AI will drive a substantial wave of device upgrades in the coming years and potentially lead to entirely new product categories.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Out hiking in an all-male group one day, Kasia Bromley was ridiculed for wearing non-traditional outdoor clothing. It was a lightbulb moment to create a women\u2019s brand with \u201cstyle, performance and fit\u201d, a journey which started with a pair of charity shop jeans, led to near bankruptcy and selling a car and a sofa \u2013 with risk and reward aplenty. Bromley\u2019s Flintshire-based company, Acai Outdoorwear, will mark 10 years in business next year alongside her co-founder husband Joe. So will the Polish-born entrepreneur allow herself a period of reflection despite the business hardships? \u201cI love a good reflection,\u201d smiles Bromley. \u201cI am a forward thinker. I enjoy it now as I don\u2019t feel what I felt when I did feel the pain. I kind of laugh at it now as it\u2019s been all good learning and I have an anecdote or two.\u201d Read More: What\u2019s Your Dream? Why Simon Squibb is sharing his business knowledge for free Bromley certainly has the latter as she charts her story from fashion catwalks to mountain trails and a UK-leading women\u2019s outdoor apparel company posting revenues today of \u00a35.5m. Growing up in rural Poland and dreaming of becoming a fashion designer as an eight-year-old, Bromley attended Edinburgh College of Art in 2012 before applying for an internship at Alexander McQueen. The highlight was working painstakingly on hundreds of hand-cut feathers for the butterfly dress seen in The Hunger Games film. She returned to Scotland \u201cdrained\u201d and soon had fears she might struggle working at the top end of the fashion industry despite having a fearless work ethic. Bromley took to the outdoors \u2014 a former boyfriend was a mountain leader who trained at Aviemore \u2014 and started hiking in a male group. \u201cOne day I was wearing a T-shirt and a pair of leggings,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t look like your traditional hiker with the big over trousers and purple jacket. I looked different and they picked up on that. It was a moment of realisation that there was something not quite right with this space.\u201d She later ripped up her \u00a35 charity shop jeans, started to create patterns and told new boyfriend Joe her idea for Acai on their first date. After quitting her job at a Scottish cycling brand, she then went with Joe to South Korea, where he worked in the oil industry. Bromley set up a studio with a sewing machine in Busan and says it was transformational, being an hour\u2019s drive from the home of performance fabrics. Soon, she had a collection of 14 handmade outdoor styles, including her soon-to-be signature skinny outdoor trousers. Returning to the UK, Acai launched at wholesale trade shows in 2016 and received an order for 20 stores at House of Fraser before the retailer went into administration. In 2017, the duo launched their e-commerce website, but encountered financial trouble six months later. They postponed their wedding, invested their house deposit, used all of Joe\u2019s redundancy money, and sold their car and sofa to buy the stock and continue selling. Read More: 'We lost 50kg between us and now own a \u00a335m meal prep business' By January 2018, Bromley had inspected their stock in China but were still short of cash. The bank turned down a loan and overdraft, before Joe turned to a pre-order app. It proved a fruitful decision; the strategy generated \u00a310,000 in 24 hours. Its hero trouser product has since sold well over 50,000 units. With her husband\u2019s technical skills at budgeting on a \u2018shoe string\u2019 as well as dealing with manufacturing issues, which saw the company write off \u00a320,000 of stock, Bromley worked as the product creative. Neither had marketing skills nor knew how to build a brand. \u201cWe figured everything out ourselves. We just winged it,\u201d admits Cheshire-based Bromley. The pair continued attending consumer and trade shows to put themselves in front of customers. \u201cIt was really powerful to get us out there in front of our audience,\u201d she adds. \u201cPeople would flick through our collection, come across our hiking trousers and we knew we had a golden nugget.\u201d From the 14 original styles, the couple decided to pivot and focus on their trousers. \u201cIt\u2019s what saved the business because of that one product,\u201d says Bromley. \u201cIt was quite risky and brave to pivot at the time, but we were going to try and compete in that space and leave something special that no one else had. We both felt it was the right thing to do.\u201d At their first investment round in 2019, the Bromleys closed a deal five days before Kasia was due to have their second child. Post-birth complications meant that she missed their first board meeting, while COVID left its initial investors fearing any growth. Acai stopped advertising and focused on gardening content \u2014 her parents had a flower business \u2014 on their social channels. Sales more than doubled and Bromley says they achieved their five-year plan in 18 months. Its core demographic is for women aged 40-50, while Acai Outdoorwear has also expanded its product range and physical presence with tie-ups with Snow + Rock and Go Outdoors.

Finding your niche It\u2019s important in business to be known and to be amazing for one thing and then branch out. Be niche-specific and build on that foundation. Had we not decided to sack off 13 pieces of our collection and focus on one, we wouldn\u2019t be here today. Being accessible We launched our Outdoorsing Club in 2021 with the belief that being outdoors is so good for our mental core wellbeing. We sponsor accessible walks across the UK and looking back to that story in the Highlands, I didn\u2019t look like the traditional hiker. The brand was about building the outdoors as accessible and that it should be part of our everyday lives. Purpose You go through a lot as an entrepreneur. Having something with a purpose that you enjoy and totally believe in makes all the difference. Otherwise, it can break you. Being direct in business I have made mistakes but the one thing I stand by is that being direct is not rude. It\u2019s honest and sometimes honesty is not what we want to hear.
