The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools. Co-founder and CEO Sal Sferlazza said in a statement that as opposed to legacy tech, NinjaOne's \"multi-tenant-native architecture can innovate faster\" to generate several software solutions at once. The company snagged a   after a $500 million funding round led by Iconiq Growth and CapitalG,  's venture capital arm, in February 2025. Matarese said customers, which include IT departments and managed service providers, have reported a 50% reduction in endpoint management and support costs and a 20% boost in staff retention after adopting NinjaOne. \"About 75% of our customers replace four tools or more when they use Ninja,\" he said. \"The less tools you have, the more everything is unified, the better everything works.\" He added that the company expects another 60% to 70% in revenue growth for 2026 and plans to launch five to six additional products over the next year, some of which may incorporate  . Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead.  Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition. In October, NinjaOne rolled out its  , which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow. \"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"",

Stord is part of a crowded market of startups that provide logistics and fulfillment services to online businesses, including ShipBob, Flexport's Deliverr,   and Shipmonk.

                "full_text": "The Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth. Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

                "full_text": "The Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth. Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools.

Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead.  Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition. In October, NinjaOne rolled out its  , which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow. \"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"",

                "full_text": "Software startup NinjaOne has surpassed $500 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR, the company announced Tuesday. The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools. Co-founder and CEO Sal Sferlazza said in a statement that as opposed to legacy tech, NinjaOne's \"multi-tenant-native architecture can innovate faster\" to generate several software solutions at once. The company snagged a   after a $500 million funding round led by Iconiq Growth and CapitalG,  's venture capital arm, in February 2025. Matarese said customers, which include IT departments and managed service providers, have reported a 50% reduction in endpoint management and support costs and a 20% boost in staff retention after adopting NinjaOne. \"About 75% of our customers replace four tools or more when they use Ninja,\" he said. \"The less tools you have, the more everything is unified, the better everything works.\" He added that the company expects another 60% to 70% in revenue growth for 2026 and plans to launch five to six additional products over the next year, some of which may incorporate  . Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead.  Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition. In October, NinjaOne rolled out its  , which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow. \"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"",

                "full_text": "The Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth. Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

The deal, which closed Jan. 1 for a undisclosed amount, adds 12 new locations to Stord's growing logistics network and about 60 new employees. Shipwire is an AI fulfillment platform used by e-commerce firms.  \"This is a great network, great customers, great team to pull onto our technology and our combined scale,\" CEO Sean Henry told CNBC. \"And with that scale, it spins our flywheel up.\" The deal also brings dozens of new large and mid-market customers and a host of AI-powered internal execution, planning and routing tools to Stord's network, he added.  Stord will look to partner with CEVA's 120 million square foot network across 170 countries. This is the seventh acquisition from the Atlanta-based startup that's challenging e-commerce giants such as   by building out a network of infrastructure to help lower shipping costs and speed up deliveries for smaller merchants.  Stord is part of a crowded market of startups that provide logistics and fulfillment services to online businesses, including ShipBob, Flexport's Deliverr,   and Shipmonk.  Demand for these services has only continued to grow as more consumers shop online, and as merchants increasingly operate storefronts on multiple platforms.  Amazon has sought to capitalize on the trend by offering a competing service that lets businesses tap into its network to ship orders placed on other sites, called  . Stord has been on an expansion spree. In May, Stord bought third-party delivery company and   subsidiary Ware2Go for an undisclosed amount earlier this year.

Henry told CNBC that the company is looking to make more acquisitions like Shipwire over the coming months and is eyeing expansions into Australia and Asia. Stord's   includes facilities in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and the Netherlands.  Last year, Stord raised $200 million at $1.5 billion valuation. Major investors include Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund,   Ventures and Strike Capital. Stord was founded in 2015 by 18-year-old Henry, who dropped out of the Georgia Institute of Technology to pursue the prestigious Thiel Fellowship, which was founded by Peter Thiel.

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools. Co-founder and CEO Sal Sferlazza said in a statement that as opposed to legacy tech, NinjaOne's \"multi-tenant-native architecture can innovate faster\" to generate several software solutions at once. The company snagged a   after a $500 million funding round led by Iconiq Growth and CapitalG,  's venture capital arm, in February 2025. Matarese said customers, which include IT departments and managed service providers, have reported a 50% reduction in endpoint management and support costs and a 20% boost in staff retention after adopting NinjaOne. \"About 75% of our customers replace four tools or more when they use Ninja,\" he said. \"The less tools you have, the more everything is unified, the better everything works.\" He added that the company expects another 60% to 70% in revenue growth for 2026 and plans to launch five to six additional products over the next year, some of which may incorporate  . Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead.  Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition. In October, NinjaOne rolled out its  , which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow. \"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"",

Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.\" Lecun, 65, added that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved\" after the company was accused of gaming benchmarks to make its   model look more impressive.

Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000.

The deal, which closed Jan. 1 for a undisclosed amount, adds 12 new locations to Stord's growing logistics network and about 60 new employees. Shipwire is an AI fulfillment platform used by e-commerce firms.  \"This is a great network, great customers, great team to pull onto our technology and our combined scale,\" CEO Sean Henry told CNBC. \"And with that scale, it spins our flywheel up.\" The deal also brings dozens of new large and mid-market customers and a host of AI-powered internal execution, planning and routing tools to Stord's network, he added.

Stord is part of a crowded market of startups that provide logistics and fulfillment services to online businesses, including ShipBob, Flexport's Deliverr,   and Shipmonk.

                "full_text": "The Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth. Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools. Co-founder and CEO Sal Sferlazza said in a statement that as opposed to legacy tech, NinjaOne's \"multi-tenant-native architecture can innovate faster\" to generate several software solutions at once.

Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead.

Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow. \"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"",

                "full_text": "The Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth. Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

His hiring came amid an intensifying  , in which Meta reportedly offered   to poach top talent from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, as it raced other hyperscalers to dominate the multibillion-dollar AI market with the most advanced models. Lecun, who's known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\" and quit Meta in November, called Wang \"young\" and \"inexperienced\" in an interview with the  . \"He learns fast, he knows what he doesn't know,\" Lecun said of Wang, who heads up Meta's new AI research unit TBD Labs and is tasked with building new AI models. But Lecun added: \"There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.\" Lecun, 65, added that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved\" after the company was accused of gaming benchmarks to make its   model look more impressive. Zuckerberg \"basically sidelined the entire Gen AI organization,\" Lecun said. \"A lot of people have left, a lot of people who haven't yet left will leave,\" Lecun added. \"We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,\" he said. \"When you do this, you fall behind.\" CNBC contacted Meta for a response, but had not received a response as this story went live. When asked about Meta's AI hiring drive, Lecun said: \"The future will say whether that was a good idea or not.\" But he added that \"LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence.\" \"I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that,\" Lecun said. Lecun's new startup, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, is focusing on \"world models:\" AI systems that learn from videos and physical data as well as language.  Nabla, a health tech AI startup that partnered with Lecun's company in December, said in a   that, unlike world models, LLMs \"still face some structural constraints, including hallucinations, non-deterministic reasoning and limited handling of continuous multimodal data, which make autonomous decision-making challenging.\"",

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools. Co-founder and CEO Sal Sferlazza said in a statement that as opposed to legacy tech, NinjaOne's \"multi-tenant-native architecture can innovate faster\" to generate several software solutions at once. The company snagged a   after a $500 million funding round led by Iconiq Growth and CapitalG,  's venture capital arm, in February 2025. Matarese said customers, which include IT departments and managed service providers, have reported a 50% reduction in endpoint management and support costs and a 20% boost in staff retention after adopting NinjaOne. \"About 75% of our customers replace four tools or more when they use Ninja,\" he said. \"The less tools you have, the more everything is unified, the better everything works.\" He added that the company expects another 60% to 70% in revenue growth for 2026 and plans to launch five to six additional products over the next year, some of which may incorporate  . Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead.  Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition. In October, NinjaOne rolled out its  , which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow. \"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"",

                "full_text": "The Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth. Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article  former chief AI scientist, Yann Lecun, has called its 29-year-old AI boss \"inexperienced,\" and warned of a staff exodus from the company. Alexander Wang, the billionaire co-founder of Scale AI, joined Meta as its chief AI officer in 2025 after the tech giant bought a 49% stake in his startup.  His hiring came amid an intensifying  , in which Meta reportedly offered   to poach top talent from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, as it raced other hyperscalers to dominate the multibillion-dollar AI market with the most advanced models. Lecun, who's known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\" and quit Meta in November, called Wang \"young\" and \"inexperienced\" in an interview with the  . \"He learns fast, he knows what he doesn't know,\" Lecun said of Wang, who heads up Meta's new AI research unit TBD Labs and is tasked with building new AI models. But Lecun added: \"There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.\" Lecun, 65, added that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved\" after the company was accused of gaming benchmarks to make its   model look more impressive. Zuckerberg \"basically sidelined the entire Gen AI organization,\" Lecun said. \"A lot of people have left, a lot of people who haven't yet left will leave,\" Lecun added. \"We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,\" he said. \"When you do this, you fall behind.\" CNBC contacted Meta for a response, but had not received a response as this story went live. When asked about Meta's AI hiring drive, Lecun said: \"The future will say whether that was a good idea or not.\" But he added that \"LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence.\" \"I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that,\" Lecun said. Lecun's new startup, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, is focusing on \"world models:\" AI systems that learn from videos and physical data as well as language.  Nabla, a health tech AI startup that partnered with Lecun's company in December, said in a   that, unlike world models, LLMs \"still face some structural constraints, including hallucinations, non-deterministic reasoning and limited handling of continuous multimodal data, which make autonomous decision-making challenging.\"",

Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of   on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents.  \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote.  San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego.  Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly   for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger.  \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla   on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as   crypto and artificial intelligence czar,   last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder  , have considered leaving,   reported. \"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\" Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\" The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the  , is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget.  Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot. A   from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to  . A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"",

                "full_text": "In this article  former chief AI scientist, Yann Lecun, has called its 29-year-old AI boss \"inexperienced,\" and warned of a staff exodus from the company. Alexander Wang, the billionaire co-founder of Scale AI, joined Meta as its chief AI officer in 2025 after the tech giant bought a 49% stake in his startup.  His hiring came amid an intensifying  , in which Meta reportedly offered   to poach top talent from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, as it raced other hyperscalers to dominate the multibillion-dollar AI market with the most advanced models. Lecun, who's known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\" and quit Meta in November, called Wang \"young\" and \"inexperienced\" in an interview with the  . \"He learns fast, he knows what he doesn't know,\" Lecun said of Wang, who heads up Meta's new AI research unit TBD Labs and is tasked with building new AI models. But Lecun added: \"There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.\" Lecun, 65, added that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved\" after the company was accused of gaming benchmarks to make its   model look more impressive. Zuckerberg \"basically sidelined the entire Gen AI organization,\" Lecun said. \"A lot of people have left, a lot of people who haven't yet left will leave,\" Lecun added. \"We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,\" he said. \"When you do this, you fall behind.\" CNBC contacted Meta for a response, but had not received a response as this story went live. When asked about Meta's AI hiring drive, Lecun said: \"The future will say whether that was a good idea or not.\" But he added that \"LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence.\" \"I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that,\" Lecun said. Lecun's new startup, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, is focusing on \"world models:\" AI systems that learn from videos and physical data as well as language.  Nabla, a health tech AI startup that partnered with Lecun's company in December, said in a   that, unlike world models, LLMs \"still face some structural constraints, including hallucinations, non-deterministic reasoning and limited handling of continuous multimodal data, which make autonomous decision-making challenging.\"",

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools. Co-founder and CEO Sal Sferlazza said in a statement that as opposed to legacy tech, NinjaOne's \"multi-tenant-native architecture can innovate faster\" to generate several software solutions at once. The company snagged a   after a $500 million funding round led by Iconiq Growth and CapitalG,  's venture capital arm, in February 2025. Matarese said customers, which include IT departments and managed service providers, have reported a 50% reduction in endpoint management and support costs and a 20% boost in staff retention after adopting NinjaOne. \"About 75% of our customers replace four tools or more when they use Ninja,\" he said. \"The less tools you have, the more everything is unified, the better everything works.\" He added that the company expects another 60% to 70% in revenue growth for 2026 and plans to launch five to six additional products over the next year, some of which may incorporate  . Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead.  Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition. In October, NinjaOne rolled out its  , which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow. \"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"",

The diffusion index represents the percentage of companies reporting expansion, so anything above 50 indicates growth, albeit at a slower pace in the case of December.

His hiring came amid an intensifying  , in which Meta reportedly offered   to poach top talent from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, as it raced other hyperscalers to dominate the multibillion-dollar AI market with the most advanced models.

Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.\" Lecun, 65, added that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved\" after the company was accused of gaming benchmarks to make its   model look more impressive. Zuckerberg \"basically sidelined the entire Gen AI organization,\" Lecun said. \"A lot of people have left, a lot of people who haven't yet left will leave,\" Lecun added. \"We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,\" he said. \"When you do this, you fall behind.\" CNBC contacted Meta for a response, but had not received a response as this story went live. When asked about Meta's AI hiring drive, Lecun said: \"The future will say whether that was a good idea or not.\" But he added that \"LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence.\" \"I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that,\" Lecun said. Lecun's new startup, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, is focusing on \"world models:\" AI systems that learn from videos and physical data as well as language.  Nabla, a health tech AI startup that partnered with Lecun's company in December, said in a   that, unlike world models, LLMs \"still face some structural constraints, including hallucinations, non-deterministic reasoning and limited handling of continuous multimodal data, which make autonomous decision-making challenging.\"",

The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000. President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support. \"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said. Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools.
