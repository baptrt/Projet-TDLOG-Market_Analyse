        "full_text": "Executives at D-Wave Quantum are cashing out their stock. Perhaps the most dominant theme in the stock market over the last three years is the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Seemingly overnight, technology giants such as Microsoft , Alphabet , Amazon , Tesla , and Meta Platforms pivoted their respective business models to go all in on artificial intelligence. Now that we're three years into the AI revolution, a new chapter is starting to be written. Investors are increasingly looking for the next breakthrough, and an emerging technology called quantum computing seems to be the lead candidate for AI's next megatrend. D-Wave Quantum ( QBTS +1.12% ) is a pure-play quantum AI stock whose shares have rocketed by 677% over the last year -- absolutely trouncing the gains seen in Nvidia , the S&P 500 , and the Nasdaq Composite . Despite its performance, D-Wave's leadership just sent a $43 million warning to investors. Is now a good time to sell your D-Wave stock? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. The algorithms that run classical computing are written in long lines of binary bits coded in 0's and 1's. Quantum computers also use this structure; however, the underlying codebase can process algorithms in multiple places at one time through a property known as superposition. Given these characteristics, the code in quantum computers are referred to as qubits (quantum bits). The underlying theory is that quantum computers can process extremely sophisticated datasets at much faster speeds and higher precision compared to today's most powerful supercomputers. Should these breakthroughs come to fruition, quantum computers could revolutionize critical services including modeling energy patterns, sophisticated financial simulations, cryptography, logistics, drug discovery, and more. Given the variety and importance of quantum AI's use cases, it's not surprising that management consulting firm McKinsey & Company is forecasting this technology to add up to $2 trillion in economic value by 2035. Given the exploratory nature of quantum computing, there are quite a few dense physics terms that are often thrown around by the executives leading these companies. D-Wave focuses on quantum annealing, which is a technique that computers can use to run a number of simulations at once and then gradually identify the best solution. These systems rely on superconducting qubits . Broadly speaking, D-Wave's technology can be used in optimization-oriented applications such as analyzing traffic routes. Given the analysis above, it would appear that investing in quantum computing stocks could potentially yield multibagger returns for your portfolio. However, despite the company's promises, D-Wave CEO Alan Baratz has been selling stock like there is no tomorrow. Between May and November, Baratz sold over $43 million in stock. Per the Form 4 filings, his sale on Nov. 11 for roughly $23.3 million was part of a 10b5-1(c) plan. This means the sale was pre-determined. However, the rest of Baratz's stock sales over the last several months appear to be deliberate and not part of a pre-arranged agreement. Taking this one step further, D-Wave's Chief Financial Officer (CFO), John Markovich, as well as several members of the company's board of directors , have also been selling stock over the last six months or so. QBTS data by YCharts To me, it does not signal confidence when leadership uses momentum to cash out their stock at a premium. If they were so confident about D-Wave's future, then why are they collectively selling stock now when prices are soaring? I think that retail investors are falling for the idea that quantum computing could be the next big thing, and unfortunately, many are buying the shares that these corporate executives are unloading. All told, if I owned D-Wave stock, I would consider selling at this time. The stock still trades at a lofty valuation that it likely won't be able to sustain in the long run. Against this backdrop, now may be a good time to consider exiting a position in D-Wave and rotating your capital into more diversified AI and quantum computing stocks within big tech. This approach provides investors with exposure to established AI leaders and a more insulated display of quantum computing without being overly vulnerable to this speculative movement.

        "full_text": "Nvidia remains the best overall AI stock for investors to buy in 2026. Welcome to part five of a seven-article series in which I rank the best \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks to buy for 2026 (in reverse order). Tesla came in last , followed by Apple as the sixth pick , Amazon at No. 5 , Alphabet in the fourth spot , and now Nvidia ( NVDA 1.81% ) winning the bronze. Microsoft and Meta Platforms will go head-to-head for the heavyweight title in two separate upcoming articles. While Tesla and Apple are not worth buying right now, I believe Amazon, Alphabet, Nvidia, and then Meta Platforms and Microsoft are. Here's why Nvidia remains one of the best growth stocks to buy in 2026, even after soaring over tenfold over the last three years. Image source: Nvidia. One of the most challenging investment decisions is whether to buy a stock that has skyrocketed in value. Especially a stock like Nvidia, which has gone from being an industry leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) for professional visualization, gaming, automotive, and cryptocurrency mining to completely switching gears and getting the vast majority of its operating income from data centers. Nvidia was well positioned to capitalize on the surge in artificial intelligence (AI) spending. But what's arguably more impressive is what the company has done since the boom began in early 2023. Nvidia continues to push the limits of data center efficiency with its Blackwell GPU and associated hardware and software. In its latest quarter, Nvidia announced that it has become the largest networking business in the world -- with networking revenue up 264% over the past year. In fact, Nvidia's networking business generated more revenue in third-quarter fiscal 2026 than gaming and AI PC, professional visualization, and automotive and robotics combined . During its Nov. 19 earnings call , Nvidia said that demand continues to outpace its GPU supply, signaling strong potential growth for years to come. In late October, Nvidia announced $500 billion in AI chip orders for Blackwell and its upcoming Rubin GPUs. That includes both booked orders and revenue that will be realized through the end of fiscal 2026. On the Nov. 19 earnings call, Nvidia stated that it will likely be taking more orders, so there's an opportunity for the $500 billion number to increase. Nvidia's surging earnings and investor optimism are fueling its red-hot stock price. And there's reason to believe that can continue, given Nvidia's upbeat forecast and its sky-high operating margins , despite competition from Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices . The only reason the stock isn't higher on my Magnificent Seven list is that Microsoft and Meta Platforms are also high-margin companies with multiple avenues for steady growth in the coming years. Nvidia could capitalize on its upcoming orders and then be vulnerable to a pullback in AI spending, given that essentially the entire investment thesis now hinges on compute and networking demand. Still, Nvidia isn't overvalued. At 38.5 times forward earnings estimates , Nvidia is cheaper than Walmart and Costco Wholesale . Find out how I rank the two remaining Magnificent Seven names in my upcoming rankings . Daniel Foelber has positions in Nvidia. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Advanced Micro Devices, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Costco Wholesale, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, and Walmart.

        "full_text": "These likely future members of the $8 trillion club share much in common. The biggest of the big keep getting bigger. That's been the story for the stock market in recent years. The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks now have a combined market cap of over $21 trillion. I suspect this trend will continue. I'll even step out on a limb and make a prediction: Each of these five stocks will be worth more than $8 trillion by 2030. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia ( NVDA 1.81% ) is the easiest pick to join the $8 trillion club within the next five years. The chipmaker's market cap already stands at $4.3 trillion. Nvidia would need to deliver average annual returns of slightly above 13% to reach a valuation of $8 trillion. In my view, two things need to happen for Nvidia to hit this threshold. First, the company must maintain its lead in the GPU market. Second, the demand for AI chips must continue to grow. I think these prerequisites will be met. Sure, Nvidia faces challengers. However, I agree with the company's recent post on X that it's \"a generation ahead of the industry.\" As for the demand for AI chips, I believe we're still in the early stages of growth. Anyone who thought that Apple ( AAPL +0.47% ) would be left behind in the dust might be reconsidering their opinion now. The iPhone maker's shares have rebounded strongly since April. Apple's market cap now tops $4 trillion. Can Apple really double its valuation by the end of the decade? I think so. The company more than doubled its market over the last five years. I predict that Apple will be able to do it again. A sustained iPhone upgrade super cycle could be just what Apple needs to reach a market cap of $8 trillion by 2030. A rumored foldable iPhone would likely push many customers to upgrade their phones. Expanded generative AI functionality could also help. However, I think a launch of top-tier smart glasses that integrate with new iPhone models is the most likely catalyst for a multi-year upgrade super cycle. Alphabet ( GOOG 0.05% ) ( GOOGL +0.06% ) takes the No. 3 and the No. 4 spots on the list because the tech giant has two share classes . With a current market cap of around $3.8 trillion, Google's parent company isn't far behind Apple. Google Cloud is Alphabet's fastest-growing unit. As such, it's the most important driver to push the company to a market cap of $8 trillion by 2030. The same AI demand that will serve as a major tailwind for Nvidia will also benefit Google Cloud. But I expect Alphabet's advertising revenue and profits from Google Search, YouTube, and other apps will also grow significantly over the next five years. The company has two potential lottery tickets as well. Its Waymo unit is the leader in autonomous ride-hailing and has tremendous growth prospects. Google Quantum AI could open up a massive opportunity for Alphabet in quantum computing . Not long ago, Microsoft ( MSFT +1.34% ) reigned as the largest company in the world. It no longer holds that position, but it is within striking distance, with a market cap of $3.6 trillion. The obvious path for Microsoft to get to $8 trillion is for the AI boom to continue unabated. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform would be a huge beneficiary from this trend. I think agentic AI presents an especially significant opportunity for Microsoft, both for Azure and the company's productivity software suite. Don't overlook Microsoft's potential in quantum computing. If the company's topoconductors – a new type of material that isn't a solid, liquid, or gas, but is instead a topological state – fulfill their potential, Microsoft could become one of the biggest quantum computing winners.

        "time": "2025-12-01 10:23:00",
        "full_text": "Apple remains Buffett's biggest bet -- for now. For nearly a decade, Apple ( AAPL +0.46% ) has been a mainstay in Berkshire Hathaway 's ( BRK.A +0.29% ) ( BRK.B +0.51% ) portfolio. In 2016, Warren Buffett first approved of adding Apple shares, initiating a $1 billion purchase. In the years that followed, Berkshire continued to add more and more Apple stock. At one point, the company's position was valued at more than $100 billion -- its biggest bet ever. Apparently, Buffett and his lieutenants are quickly souring on the stock. In six of the last eight quarters, Berkshire has sold down its stake. And while it remains Berkshire's biggest holding, Apple investors are left wondering: Why is Buffett seemingly selling his Apple stake as quickly as possible? There are two likely reasons, one of which may surprise you. It isn't just Apple stock that Buffett is selling. Many of his key positions have been trimmed in 2025. And right now, Berkshire Hathaway is holding on to more cash than it ever has in its history. Roughly one-third of its entire market cap is now tied up in cash. It's hard not to conclude that Buffett isn't a huge fan of market valuations right now. That's because he has long warned against holding cash. \"Cash is always a bad investment,\" he said in 2009. \"When people say 'cash is king,' that's crazy ... It was sure to go down in value over time.\" He went on to say that he actively avoids holding too much cash: You don't need to have excessive amounts of it around. Anytime we have surplus cash around, I'm unhappy. I would much rather have good businesses than cash. So why is Buffett holding so much cash at Berkshire? There is only one reasonable conclusion: He is having a tough time finding enough deals to absorb Berkshire's growing cash hoard. Right now, stock market valuations are near historic highs. The S&P 500 , for instance, trades above 30 times earnings, something it has done only a few times over the past three decades. So although Apple has been on the chopping block, the selling may deal with more than the company's valuation. But on that front, Buffett may have worries as well. Image source: Berkshire Hathaway. When Buffett started buying Apple stock, shares traded with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio below 3. On a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis, shares traded below a ratio of 12. Today, Apple trades above 10 times sales, with a P/E of nearly 40. All of this occurred as Apple's market cap soared from well under $1 trillion to more than $4 trillion, a reality that would theoretically make future growth harder to come by. AAPL data by YCharts. There's just one problem with this high valuation: The company's growth has slowed dramatically compared to the past. While revenue increases have varied over time, they regularly reached 10% or more from 2012 to 2022. In 2023 and 2024, however, Apple's revenue growth briefly dipped into the negatives. This year, sales gains are expected to be just 8.8%, with estimates calling for only 6.2% next year. To be sure, Apple is still a high quality business with a strong moat and cash flow profile. Sales are still rising, too, just not as quickly as in the past. But that valuation looks to have become a bit out of control, a view that Buffett seemingly agrees with now.

        "full_text": "The stock has not done hugely well over the last five years but is poised for strong performance over the next decade. Many investors are biased toward stocks in their home country, especially the U.S. And who could fault them? The U.S. market has done phenomenally well over the last 40 to 50 years, producing huge winners for people who owned the likes of Microsoft and Apple , among many other stocks. But as we sit here today in late 2025, the U.S. stock market is trading at a premium average price-to-earnings ratio ( P/E ) versus the rest of the world. And yet, some overseas stocks could now provide a great value to investors. Consider MercadoLibre ( MELI +1.78% ) . Shares of the Latin American e-commerce powerhouse have underperformed over the last five years, and it now trades at a discount when compared to its long-term potential. Here's why the stock -- with its current market cap of $100 billion -- could be worth $500 billion in 10 years. MercadoLibre operates as an e-commerce platform and financial services business in countries including Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. Founded over 25 years ago, the company has taken inspiration from the Amazon model to build up a huge network of buyers, sellers, and delivery infrastructure across its operating markets. On top of e-commerce, it has layered financial services from its Mercado Pago subsidiary, which now has 72 million monthly active users (MAUs) and grew revenue 65% year over year last quarter on a constant currency basis. Its multipronged business has enabled the company to grow impressively for many years. Total revenue was up 49% in constant currency last quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, revenue is up close to 4,000% cumulatively in the last 10 years, driven by its dual engines of e-commerce and fintech. Image source: Getty Images. Even though MercadoLibre is the largest e-commerce operator in Latin America, it is still significantly smaller than peers like Amazon since it generates just $26 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. E-commerce penetration in Latin America is much lower than other regions globally. This is due to a few reasons, including slower internet adoption, more difficult transportation routes, and poorer economies relative to places like East Asia and the U.S. Over time -- as long as these Latin American economies keep growing -- these gaps will fill in and e-commerce should keep spreading in Mexico and Brazil, providing a long-term tailwind. And we are seeing a major economic recovery in Argentina, which is one of the company's largest markets. This could turn a headwind into a tailwind if the reforms in that nation keep bearing fruit. MELI Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months. When looking at MercadoLibre's stock today, it does not seem overly cheap considering its trailing earnings before interest and taxes of just over $3 billion. With a market cap of $100 billion, that would give the stock a trailing earnings multiple between 30 and 35, depending on where the stock is trading. Anyone skeptical of the stock should zoom out and look at the long term. The company has grown impressively over the past two decades and should continue to do so in the years to come due to the factors discussed above. With higher-margin fintech revenue, its profit margin should be able to expand from the 10% level it sits at today. At $100 billion in revenue and a 20% profit margin, MercadoLibre could be generating $20 billion in earnings 10 years from now. I believe that would deserve a market cap of $500 billion, or 25 times these forward earnings estimates, making it not only the largest e-commerce player in Latin America, but also one of the largest businesses in the world.

        "full_text": "Oops, something went wrong The FTSE 100 ( ^FTSE ) and European stocks started December on the back foot, selling off as chancellor Rachel Reeves and prime minister Keir Starmer continue to defend the details of last week's budget and their actions in the lead-up to it. The moves lower match a broadly risk averse mood across major markets, with the Nikkei ( ^N225 ) in Japan and US stock futures also losing ground. Major cryptocurrencies bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) also sold off. Reeves and Starmer face accusations that they misled the public in the weeks preceding the budget by overstating the dire state of public finances. It was clear that the UK's productivity performance was \"weaker than previously thought\", Reeves said in a speech last month. Critics point to a letter from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the end of October with calculations showing higher wages may offset the weakness in productivity. The letter also seems to show that Reeves was on track to meet her fiscal rules by 2029/30.

He said he was proud of the measures laid out on 26 November, and that they would go some way to tackling child poverty, among other social issues. London's premier index hovered below the flatline by noon, with its top fallers Intertek Group ( ITRK.L ) and Melrose Industries ( MRO.L ) The DAX ( ^GDAXI ) in Germany lost 1.3% In Paris, the CAC 40 ( ^FCHI ) fell 0.7% The pan-European STOXX 600 ( ^STOXX ) dipped 0.4% The pound headed towards the $1.32 mark against the dollar ( GBPUSD=X ), declining slightly by lunch Stocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio Yahoo Finance UK's Pedro Goncalves writes: Oil prices edged higher on Monday after Opec+ opted to keep production plans unchanged, while Ukrainian drone strikes on two Russian “shadow fleet” tankers revived concerns over supply disruptions. Brent crude futures rose 1.7% to $63.44 per barrel at the time of writing, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures climbed 1.9% to $59.65 a barrel. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, said the reaction in US crude prices reflected expectations of tighter market management. “US crude is up more than 2% this morning as OPEC reiterated yesterday that they want to stabilise oil prices into next year, implying tighter control of output to address the supply glut that has weighed on prices – except during brief periods of geopolitical tension,” she said. “And even those tensions haven’t been enough lately to bring buyers back, which shows how much oil is currently sloshing around the planet. As discussed in previous reports, OPEC alone can’t reverse the broader negative price dynamic, but it can help put a floor under the latest selloff.” Geopolitical risks also returned to focus after Ukrainian naval drones struck two sanctioned Russian tankers in the Black Sea. The incident raised the possibility of further curbs to Russian supply, particularly after the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which moves more than 1% of global oil, halted operations last weekend when a mooring at its Black Sea terminal was damaged in a separate Ukrainian drone attack. Oil prices have come under sustained pressure in recent months, logging a fourth consecutive monthly decline in November after the International Energy Agency projected a record surplus in 2026. Brent crude is down 15% so far this year. Stephen Innes, at SPI Asset Management, said the Opec+ announcement “marks a subtle but important shift: after releasing roughly 2.9 million barrels per day back into the market since April 2025, the coalition has decided that regaining market share is less urgent than preserving what’s left of the price floor”. Jim Reid, analyst at Deutsche Bank, added that the market remained restrained as traders grew “cautious on the prospects of a possible peace deal in Ukraine”. ITV's Robert Peston asks Starmer about trade deals with Europe. Starmer says: \"We do need to get closer to the EU\" He adds: It's clear from the evidence that the deal we have hurt our economy. There will be \"many more decisions that are not cost free, and are not easy,\" says Starmer. \"We can all see the challenge: low productivity. [...] We need a productivity revolution,\" he adds. Starmer is touting the benefits of cutting red tape to improve the speed of implementing key infrastructure projects. In addition to accepting the Fingleton recommendations in a recent report which made recommendations about Britain's nuclear strategy, he's asking his ministers to apply these across the entire industrial strategy. Prime minister Keir Starmer is speaking right now espousing the social benefits of scrapping the two-child benefit cap and raising the minimum wage in last week's budget. He says lifting the cap is a fairness issue, an economic issue, and an issue that will help lessen the pressure on the NHS. \"I remember my family sitting around the kitchen table, worrying about the bills,\" he says. \"That's still the reality for too many people.\" He argues the budget is about making life better for working people and giving children a chance in life. \"Tax rises make life harder for people\" but \"politics is about making choices,\" he adds. \"We all know the risks of reckless borrowing — that is the path that Liz Truss took.\" AJ Bell investment director, Russ Mould, said: UK manufacturing was in expansion in November, according to S&P Global's latest PMI for the UK, rising for a second consecutive month as the recent downturn in new business intakes halted. Survey data indicated that manufacturers benefited from improved domestic demand and a softer contraction in new export work. The PMI rose to a 14-month high of 50.2 in November, up from 49.7 in October. This was the first reading above the PMI's neutral 50 mark since September 2024. The latest survey was conducted from 12-25 November, closing before the Chancellor's Budget announcement on November 26. Two of the PMI components (output and suppliers' delivery times) were at levels consistent with improved operating conditions. Stocks of purchases and employment registered contractions and new orders were unchanged over the month. The risk-off mood crept into crypto on Monday, too, with the selloff for bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) worsening. As of 8.30am in London the digital asset was trading around the $86,600 mark. Over the last 30 days it has lost more than 20% in value selling off from highs earlier in the year of close to $125,000. Economic uncertainty in the US is among factors weighing on crypto this morning, with uncertainty around the possibility of interest rate cuts top of mind for traders. Fresh warnings from the People's Bank of China related to activity surrounding digital currencies have also weighed on prices and crypto-related stocks listed in Hong Kong. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) also sold off losing about 5.8% compared with the day before to trade at the $2,836 mark. Our US team writes: US stock futures sank on Monday morning, with Wall Street's strong late-November rebound looking set to hit a speed bump in the first trading day of December. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( YM=F ) fell 0.5%. S&P 500 futures ( ES=F ) dropped 0.6%, and Nasdaq 100 futures ( NQ=F ) slid 0.8%. The declines follow holiday-shortened weekly gains for equities. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) surged 3.7% and the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) jumped nearly 5%, snapping out of a choppy November. The Dow ( ^DJI ) logged a solid 3.2% rise. Monday kicks off the first trading session of December, historically one of the market’s friendliest months. However, much of that boost can be attributed to the \"Santa Claus rally,\" a period of heightened trading over the Christmas break. This year, analysts are pulling back from the concept of a booming holiday season after much of the year has been unpredictable — while consistently bucking seasonal trends. Bloomberg reported this morning : Hello from London. Lucy Harley-McKeown here. The budget is still top of the agenda this week, as prime minister Keir Starmer did the rounds on TV this morning defending it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has been accused of telling lies about the state of the economy as cover for hiking taxes and expanding the benefit bill. Starmer is set to speak at around 10.30am in defence of the various tax rises and new spending pledges. Market watchers will also be monitoring the oil price as the OPEC+ meet to discuss output. In terms of data releases, PMIs for manufacturing will give a read on the health of industry in Japan, Asia, Europe and the UK. Over in the US, they will be anticipating fresh data on car sales.

        "full_text": "BREAKING: Futures Fall; Trump Says He's Made Fed Chief Pick T-Mobile US ( TMUS ) has launched the most aggressive Black Friday holiday promotion for wireless phone subscribers, analysts say. T-Mobile stock and shares in AT&T ( T ) and Verizon Communications ( VZ ) have been pressured by investor worries over a wireless price war. Wireless competition has intensified in 2025, pressuring profit margins, say Wall Street analysts. AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile have increased subsidies on mobile phones amid Apple 's ( AAPL ) rollout of iPhone 17 models. And, the wireless firms have stepped up phone trade-in promotions that offer consumers buyouts if they terminate contracts. \"All three carriers are getting aggressive on promos surrounding iPhone 17s, iPads and Apple watches, with T-Mobile leading the pack with its four lines for $25 per month each and a free iPhone on each line without a trade in,\" said TD Cowen analyst Gregory Williams in a report. He added: \"As carriers surgically pick and choose holiday offers, pulsing in and out of the market, we'll keep an eye on if Verizon and AT&T release 'me too' offers that look and feel similar to T-Mobile's.\" Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson, holds a similar view. \"T-Mobile's acquisition offers are richer than last year's, and dramatically so for customers on entry-level plans,\" said Moffett in a report. \"T-Mobile has enormously upped the ante for switchers opting for entry-level plans. But their offers for switchers opting for premium plans have been significantly sweetened, as well.\" Moffett added: \"T-Mobile's Black Friday offers were similarly eye-catching last year, and the additional devices require new service plans. But in a sign of the times, each element of T-Mobile's offer is richer, and the hurdles to eligibility lower, than last year.\" Controlled by Deutsche Telekom ( DTEGY ), T-Mobile reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that edged by consensus estimates while adding more high-spending phone subscribers than expected. Also, T-Mobile said it added over one million \"postpaid\" phone subscribers vs. estimates of 841,000. That topped AT&T, which added 405,000, and Verizon. What To Do After Big Bullish Market Week T-Mobile stock has dropped 5% in 2025 and has retreated from a high of 276.49 set on March 3. At Oppenheimer, analyst Timothy Horan recently downgraded TMUS stock to market perform from outperform. \"We think the company will have a difficult time beating subscriber and free cash flow estimates after a decade of outsized share gains and margin expansion,\" Horan said in a report. \"We believe that overall industry subscriber growth is set to slow and will intensify competition. In this regard, Comcast ( CMCSA ) has aggressively lowered its broadband prices, and we expect Verizon to use its $4 billion in expense savings  to increase handset promotions and content bundles. We suspect this intense competition will last a year or two, and ultimately T-Mobile will look to increase prices and slow share gains.\" T-Mobile in September named Chief Operating Officer Srini Gopalan as its next CEO. Gopalan succeeded Mike Sievert, who led T-Mobile after its 2020 merger with rival Sprint. Further, T-Mobile stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of E. That gauges institutional buying and selling of the stock over the past 13 weeks. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral. T-Mobile shares hold a disappointing IBD Composite Rating of 40 out of a best-possible 99.
