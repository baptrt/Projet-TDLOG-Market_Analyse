        "time": "2025-12-01 10:23:00",
        "full_text": "Apple remains Buffett's biggest bet -- for now. For nearly a decade, Apple ( AAPL +0.46% ) has been a mainstay in Berkshire Hathaway 's ( BRK.A +0.29% ) ( BRK.B +0.51% ) portfolio. In 2016, Warren Buffett first approved of adding Apple shares, initiating a $1 billion purchase. In the years that followed, Berkshire continued to add more and more Apple stock. At one point, the company's position was valued at more than $100 billion -- its biggest bet ever. Apparently, Buffett and his lieutenants are quickly souring on the stock. In six of the last eight quarters, Berkshire has sold down its stake. And while it remains Berkshire's biggest holding, Apple investors are left wondering: Why is Buffett seemingly selling his Apple stake as quickly as possible? There are two likely reasons, one of which may surprise you. It isn't just Apple stock that Buffett is selling. Many of his key positions have been trimmed in 2025. And right now, Berkshire Hathaway is holding on to more cash than it ever has in its history. Roughly one-third of its entire market cap is now tied up in cash. It's hard not to conclude that Buffett isn't a huge fan of market valuations right now. That's because he has long warned against holding cash. \"Cash is always a bad investment,\" he said in 2009. \"When people say 'cash is king,' that's crazy ... It was sure to go down in value over time.\" He went on to say that he actively avoids holding too much cash: You don't need to have excessive amounts of it around. Anytime we have surplus cash around, I'm unhappy. I would much rather have good businesses than cash. So why is Buffett holding so much cash at Berkshire? There is only one reasonable conclusion: He is having a tough time finding enough deals to absorb Berkshire's growing cash hoard. Right now, stock market valuations are near historic highs. The S&P 500 , for instance, trades above 30 times earnings, something it has done only a few times over the past three decades. So although Apple has been on the chopping block, the selling may deal with more than the company's valuation. But on that front, Buffett may have worries as well. Image source: Berkshire Hathaway. When Buffett started buying Apple stock, shares traded with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio below 3. On a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis, shares traded below a ratio of 12. Today, Apple trades above 10 times sales, with a P/E of nearly 40. All of this occurred as Apple's market cap soared from well under $1 trillion to more than $4 trillion, a reality that would theoretically make future growth harder to come by. AAPL data by YCharts. There's just one problem with this high valuation: The company's growth has slowed dramatically compared to the past. While revenue increases have varied over time, they regularly reached 10% or more from 2012 to 2022. In 2023 and 2024, however, Apple's revenue growth briefly dipped into the negatives. This year, sales gains are expected to be just 8.8%, with estimates calling for only 6.2% next year. To be sure, Apple is still a high quality business with a strong moat and cash flow profile. Sales are still rising, too, just not as quickly as in the past. But that valuation looks to have become a bit out of control, a view that Buffett seemingly agrees with now.

        "full_text": "The stock has not done hugely well over the last five years but is poised for strong performance over the next decade. Many investors are biased toward stocks in their home country, especially the U.S. And who could fault them? The U.S. market has done phenomenally well over the last 40 to 50 years, producing huge winners for people who owned the likes of Microsoft and Apple , among many other stocks. But as we sit here today in late 2025, the U.S. stock market is trading at a premium average price-to-earnings ratio ( P/E ) versus the rest of the world. And yet, some overseas stocks could now provide a great value to investors. Consider MercadoLibre ( MELI +1.78% ) . Shares of the Latin American e-commerce powerhouse have underperformed over the last five years, and it now trades at a discount when compared to its long-term potential. Here's why the stock -- with its current market cap of $100 billion -- could be worth $500 billion in 10 years. MercadoLibre operates as an e-commerce platform and financial services business in countries including Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. Founded over 25 years ago, the company has taken inspiration from the Amazon model to build up a huge network of buyers, sellers, and delivery infrastructure across its operating markets. On top of e-commerce, it has layered financial services from its Mercado Pago subsidiary, which now has 72 million monthly active users (MAUs) and grew revenue 65% year over year last quarter on a constant currency basis. Its multipronged business has enabled the company to grow impressively for many years. Total revenue was up 49% in constant currency last quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, revenue is up close to 4,000% cumulatively in the last 10 years, driven by its dual engines of e-commerce and fintech. Image source: Getty Images. Even though MercadoLibre is the largest e-commerce operator in Latin America, it is still significantly smaller than peers like Amazon since it generates just $26 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. E-commerce penetration in Latin America is much lower than other regions globally. This is due to a few reasons, including slower internet adoption, more difficult transportation routes, and poorer economies relative to places like East Asia and the U.S. Over time -- as long as these Latin American economies keep growing -- these gaps will fill in and e-commerce should keep spreading in Mexico and Brazil, providing a long-term tailwind. And we are seeing a major economic recovery in Argentina, which is one of the company's largest markets. This could turn a headwind into a tailwind if the reforms in that nation keep bearing fruit. MELI Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months. When looking at MercadoLibre's stock today, it does not seem overly cheap considering its trailing earnings before interest and taxes of just over $3 billion. With a market cap of $100 billion, that would give the stock a trailing earnings multiple between 30 and 35, depending on where the stock is trading. Anyone skeptical of the stock should zoom out and look at the long term. The company has grown impressively over the past two decades and should continue to do so in the years to come due to the factors discussed above. With higher-margin fintech revenue, its profit margin should be able to expand from the 10% level it sits at today. At $100 billion in revenue and a 20% profit margin, MercadoLibre could be generating $20 billion in earnings 10 years from now. I believe that would deserve a market cap of $500 billion, or 25 times these forward earnings estimates, making it not only the largest e-commerce player in Latin America, but also one of the largest businesses in the world. Brett Schafer has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Amazon, Apple, MercadoLibre, and Microsoft. The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2026 $395 calls on Microsoft and short January 2026 $405 calls on Microsoft.

        "time": "2025-12-01 12:22:55",
        "full_text": "BREAKING: Futures Fall; Trump Says He's Made Fed Chief Pick T-Mobile US ( TMUS ) has launched the most aggressive Black Friday holiday promotion for wireless phone subscribers, analysts say. T-Mobile stock and shares in AT&T ( T ) and Verizon Communications ( VZ ) have been pressured by investor worries over a wireless price war. Wireless competition has intensified in 2025, pressuring profit margins, say Wall Street analysts. AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile have increased subsidies on mobile phones amid Apple 's ( AAPL ) rollout of iPhone 17 models. And, the wireless firms have stepped up phone trade-in promotions that offer consumers buyouts if they terminate contracts. \"All three carriers are getting aggressive on promos surrounding iPhone 17s, iPads and Apple watches, with T-Mobile leading the pack with its four lines for $25 per month each and a free iPhone on each line without a trade in,\" said TD Cowen analyst Gregory Williams in a report. He added: \"As carriers surgically pick and choose holiday offers, pulsing in and out of the market, we'll keep an eye on if Verizon and AT&T release 'me too' offers that look and feel similar to T-Mobile's.\" Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson, holds a similar view. \"T-Mobile's acquisition offers are richer than last year's, and dramatically so for customers on entry-level plans,\" said Moffett in a report. \"T-Mobile has enormously upped the ante for switchers opting for entry-level plans. But their offers for switchers opting for premium plans have been significantly sweetened, as well.\" Moffett added: \"T-Mobile's Black Friday offers were similarly eye-catching last year, and the additional devices require new service plans. But in a sign of the times, each element of T-Mobile's offer is richer, and the hurdles to eligibility lower, than last year.\" Controlled by Deutsche Telekom ( DTEGY ), T-Mobile reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that edged by consensus estimates while adding more high-spending phone subscribers than expected. Also, T-Mobile said it added over one million \"postpaid\" phone subscribers vs. estimates of 841,000. That topped AT&T, which added 405,000, and Verizon. What To Do After Big Bullish Market Week T-Mobile stock has dropped 5% in 2025 and has retreated from a high of 276.49 set on March 3. At Oppenheimer, analyst Timothy Horan recently downgraded TMUS stock to market perform from outperform. \"We think the company will have a difficult time beating subscriber and free cash flow estimates after a decade of outsized share gains and margin expansion,\" Horan said in a report. \"We believe that overall industry subscriber growth is set to slow and will intensify competition. In this regard, Comcast ( CMCSA ) has aggressively lowered its broadband prices, and we expect Verizon to use its $4 billion in expense savings  to increase handset promotions and content bundles. We suspect this intense competition will last a year or two, and ultimately T-Mobile will look to increase prices and slow share gains.\" T-Mobile in September named Chief Operating Officer Srini Gopalan as its next CEO. Gopalan succeeded Mike Sievert, who led T-Mobile after its 2020 merger with rival Sprint. Further, T-Mobile stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of E. That gauges institutional buying and selling of the stock over the past 13 weeks. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral. T-Mobile shares hold a disappointing IBD Composite Rating of 40 out of a best-possible 99.

        "time": "2025-12-01 12:30:33",
        "full_text": "BREAKING: Futures Fall; Trump Says He's Made Fed Chief Pick The landscape of top artificial intelligence stocks continues to evolve. Amid worries over an AI bubble, investors need to be picky when looking at semiconductor, software and other plays. Among AI stocks in the spotlight are Oracle ( ORCL ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), Palantir ( PLTR ), CoreWeave ( CRWV ) and Snowflake ( SNOW ). To be sure, top AI stocks such as Nvidia face high expectations. For many companies — such as Google parent Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Amazon.com ( AMZN ), Facebook parent Meta Platforms ( META ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) — the rise of generative AI poses both risk and opportunity. Many companies suddenly tout AI product roadmaps. In general, look for AI stocks that use artificial intelligence to improve products or gain a strategic edge. Since the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, Apple ( AAPL ) has lagged in artificial intelligence. Apple stock has gained 11% in 2025, under-performing the S&P 500. The company has been losing top AI scientists. On the other hand, Apple may surprise with the long-awaited upgrade of the Siri voice assistant in 2026 and integrating artificial intelligence into the next major iOS upgrade. In one move, Apple is targeting a health-focused AI agent, analysts say. Apple reportedly will pay Google over $1 billion annually to use its AI models in the Siri overhaul. Aside from Siri, it remains to be seen whether Apple expands into a standalone chatbot app that would take on ChatGPT. \"We believe Apple will partner with Google Gemini and make that the exclusive AI layer that fuels the Apple ecosystem looking forward,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. \"With the DoJ win this is now the route for Cupertino and Google.\" AI stocks have been volatile. And, many AI stocks have retreated from 52-week or record highs. What's clear is that investor worries over a tech bubble similar to 1999 have increased. One reason the AI trade has faltered is investor concern over some tech companies adding massive debt to fund data center infrastructure buildouts. Since the start of September, AI hyperscalers including Amazon, Google, Meta and Oracle have issued nearly $90 billion of investment-grade bonds, according to Dealogic . \"Investors have rotated away from AI infrastructure companies with elevated leverage, such as Oracle and CoreWeave, and where operating earnings growth is under pressure, such as Meta,\" said a Goldman Sachs report. \"In contrast, companies demonstrating a clear link between capex and revenues, such as the cloud platforms within Google and Amazon, have been rewarded.\" Other investor concerns over an AI bubble include the securitization of loans to data center infrastructure builders as well as the growing \"circularity\" in the AI ecosystem, which blends investments with commercial relationships. In another example of circularity, Microsoft and Nvidia will invest up to $15 billion in Anthropic. In return,  Anthropic will spend  billions of dollars on  chips and cloud computing capacity from the tech giants. Another worry is that costly AI data center infrastructure depreciates over time from an accounting point of view. That impacts earnings. Finally, the fifth reason the AI trade is in trouble involves power consumption. There's mounting concern over the U.S. electrical grid lagging China's amid massive data center build-outs. Also, some lawmakers are raising alarms over rising electricity prices for consumers. Nvidia reported earnings on Nov. 19. AI stocks initially rallied on Nvidia results and guidance, then reversed down . A bellwether for AI stocks, chip maker Nvidia has advanced 32% in 2025, rebounding from a big sell-off tied to China-based DeepSeek's AI models . Nvidia's chip sales to China are once again being blocked by the Trump administration. In a surprise move, Japan-based SoftBank has sold off its stake in Nvidia. SoftBank sold $5.8 billion worth of shares in the AI chip giant. SoftBank has been bank rolling OpenAI's expansion. Further, CoreWeave stock sold off after it reported Q3 earnings that topped views but lowered 2025 revenue guidance . CoreWeave stock has gained 82% in 2025. But shares have pulled back. CoreWeave stock hit an all-time high on June 20, with shares up 367% at that point. Also, CoreWeave has terminated its proposed acquisition of Core Scientific. Further, CoreWeave is a new AI cloud services provider that rents out Nvidia GPU-equipped servers. Its customers include OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia. Other new AI cloud infrastructure providers, also called \"neoclouds,\" include Nebius ( NBIS ), Lambda, Crusoe and Nscale. The IBD Methodology: How To Invest In Stocks While Managing Risks Among other AI stocks to watch: Broadcom ( AVGO ) stock has advanced 73% in 2025. Broadcom also has signed a big deal with OpenAI, analysts say. Further, when reporting Q2 results, Broadcom issued a strong outlook on AI chip sales . Also, shares in Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) have advanced 80% this year. AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su told investors that the company's AI data center revenue should grow by about 80% per year over the next three to five years. Despite investor worries over AI internet search competition, Google stock is up 69% in 2025. GOOGL stock hit an all-time high of 328.83 on Nov. 25 after the r elease of its Gemini 3 model . Further, Microsoft stock has advanced 16%. See The Latest Updates To IBD Watchlists Further, Oracle stock has gained 21% in 2025, but has retreated from record highs. Oracle stock soared Sept. 10 on its guidance for future contract revenue. But there's concern over Oracle's borrowing and debt to fund data center build-outs. Among data center infrastructure plays, Arista Networks ( ANET ) has gained 18% this year but has been pressured recently. Here's an interview with Arista Chief Executive Jayshree Ullal on its AI strategy. Ciena ( CIEN ), Credo Technology ( CRDO ) and Lumentum ( LITE ) also have advanced on robust internet data center orders. Having struggled to generate new revenue from \"copilots,\" software companies are now turning to autonomous, goal-driven AI agents. One big issue for software companies is how fast customers ramp up pilot programs to commercial deployment. Software companies that help customers clean up and organize their proprietary data to train AI models and build AI apps have out-performed. Among them is Palantir Technologies ( PLTR ). Palantir stock has gained 122% in 2025. Palantir — as well as Snowflake and privately held Databricks — are data management software plays. Here's a look at Databrick's strategy . Snowflake stock has advanced 62% this year. Snowflake Q3 earnings are due Dec. 3. Meanwhile, shares in Cloudflare ( NET ) have shot up 86% in 2025. To protect their content, Cloudflare recently began giving web domains the option to block AI crawlers. Here's an interview with Cloudflare Chief Executive Matthew Prince . Cloudflare sees an opportunity to be a key network provider for the agentic web by helping set the guardrails and business model around agent-to-agent transactions. On the other hand, some big-cap software companies are under-performing AI stocks. There's growing investor angst over the \"per seat\" licensing business models of some software companies if artificial intelligence improves productivity but results in the elimination of jobs. That potentially means less per-seat software licenses. Another investor concern is that more companies could develop custom software in-house using generative AI coding tools. And, there's increasing concern that OpenAI will compete with enterprise software makers. Salesforce ( CRM ) stock has retreated 31% in 2025 while ServiceNow ( NOW ) stock is down nearly 23%. Salesforce also reports Q3 earnings on Dec. 3. Adobe ( ADBE ), Workday ( WDAY ) and HubSpot ( HUBS ) are also among software companies in the red this year. Meanwhile, amid its Q3 earnings sell-off, Meta stock has gained 10% in 2025. Meta continues to overhaul its AI strategy. Meta has invested $14.9 billion in Scale AI for a 49% stake in the startup. Scale AI provides data labeling services that help train and produce AI large language models. Scale AI Chief Executive Alexandr Wang has joined a new AI research lab at Meta dedicated to pursuing \"superintelligence.\" And, Meta has hired away top scientists from OpenAI, Google and others. But pioneering AI scientist Yann LeCun has left Meta to found a startup. How To Read Stock Charts CEO Mark Zuckerberg has laid out five pillars of expected AI growth. They include improved advertising, engaging social media experiences, business messaging, the Meta AI app, and AI devices, including spatial computing. The social networking giant in April launched the Meta AI app, built with its Llama 4 training model, with chatbot and web-searching features. Previously, Llama had been embedded in Meta applications such as Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta in April released its open source Llama 4 AI model family. On the negative side, analysts say Meta has relinquished its mantle as the leader in open-source AI to Chinese companies, led by DeepSeek. Further, DeepSeek continues to innovate with AI models . OpenAI, a leader in developing AI systems, is making plenty news. Further, OpenAI has unveiled an artificial intelligence powered web browser called ChatGPT Atlas. In early October, OpenAI unveiled new capabilities for building apps inside ChatGPT. Further, ChatGPT users will be able to launch apps by starting a message with the name of an available app. OpenAI recently introduced the Sora 2 video app, which will provide competition for Meta and others. OpenAI has been leveraging its newest AI models, including GPT-5. Also, OpenAI has released a new feature that enables ChatGPT users to purchase items directly within the chatbot interface. OpenAI recently launched five agents targeting use cases such as contract review, personalized sales responses, customer support and  ticket handling — pressuring software stocks. Investors should keep a close watch on the fierce competition in AI models. Generally, the AI models are battling in reasoning and multimodal capabilities as well as computing needs. Large language models provide the building blocks to develop applications. Meanwhile, a group of investors recently paid about $6.6 billion to buy shares owned by OpenAI employees, valuing the company at $500 billion. Also, OpenAI has become one of the world's most valuable startup, overtaking Elon Musk's SpaceX. Anthropic's valuation rose to $350 billion, up from $183 billion, in September following the investments by Microsoft and Nvidia. Amazon has been a big investor in Anthropic. Meanwhile, Musk's xAI is in talks to raise $15 billion at a valuation of $230 billion. The commoditization of AI models could spur application development. While \"training\" AI models has been the biggest driver of capital spending, the market will shift to \" inferencing ,\" or running AI applications, in the long run.
